    "public_description": "Our community brings together individuals driven by a shared commitment to problem-solving, professional networking, and collaborative innovation, all with the goal of making a positive impact. We welcome a diverse range of pursuits, from side projects and small businesses to venture-backed startups and solo ventures. However, this is a space for genuine connection and exchange of ideas, not self-promotion. Please refrain from promoting personal blogs, consulting services, books, MLMs, opinions.",
    "description": "##Submission/commenting Rules:\n \n1) **10 comment karma in /r/Entrepreneur to post**  \nTo lead a discussion in /r/Entrepreneur, we require a minimum of 10 comment karma within our subreddit. This is earned by contributing thoughtful comments to others' discussions. This policy not only helps reduce spam but ensures that you understand the community's dynamics—what types of posts resonate, and what might be overlooked or poorly received.\n\nOur goal is to help your posts gain traction. Take some time to engage with the community and discover how we can best support you.\n\n2) **No Promotion**  \nPosts and comments must NOT be made for the primary purpose of selling or promoting yourself, your company or any service.\n\nDropping URLs, asking users to DM you, check your profile, or comment for private resources will all lead to a permanent ban.\n\nIt is acceptable to cite your sources, however, there should not be an explicit solicitation, advertisement, or clear promotion for the intent of awareness.\n\n3) **No Personal Attacks**  \nConstructive criticism of ideas, concepts, approaches, or plans is encouraged. Embracing reality, even when it is challenging, is a crucial aspect of business. However, personal attacks, hostility, or incitement to conflict are strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated in this community.\n\nIf you encounter threats or harassment, please report them immediately. Avoid engaging with users who are harassing you or others.\n\n4) **Links Allowed as Supporting Material ONLY**  \nThis rule exists to foster meaningful discussion. If you wish to share links, they must be directly relevant, clearly described, and essential to the conversation. Your post should include sufficient context within Reddit to enable a productive dialogue.\n\n5) **No “How To Get Rich Quick” posts**  \nThis community is NOT for quick money schemes. Entrepreneurship is often a challenging and demanding journey, requiring effort, hard work, grit, and determination. Posts asking how to make $X, without a specific or reasonable idea, will not be tolerated, as they do not contribute meaningfully to the discussions in this subreddit.\n\n6) **Avoid unprofessional communication**  \nAs a professional subreddit, we expect all members to uphold a standard of reasonable decorum. Treat fellow entrepreneurs with the same respect you would show a colleague. While we don't have an HR department, that’s no excuse for aggressive, foul, or unprofessional behavior. NSFW topics are permitted, but they must be clearly labeled. When in doubt, label it.\n\nAI-generated content is not acceptable to be posted. If your posts or comments were generated with AI, you may face a permanent ban.  \n\n7) **No free offerings threads**  \nOur \"Thank You Thursday\" threads are designated for any promotions, offers, or discounts you wish to share with the community. Please refrain from posting free offerings outside of this weekly thread that is pinned to the top of the community. Any such posts made elsewhere will be removed.\n\n8) **Follow the [Rules of Reddit](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)**  \nThey apply everywhere on Reddit. Also consider [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette/) The latter isn't mandatory but might be used in considering the intent of your post.\n\n9) **Unsolicited Opinions and Duplicate Thoughts**  \nPosts in Entrepreneur should be unique. If a duplicate post can be found on one or more similar subreddits or on a blog, then it's not a good fit for this subreddit.\n\nPlease refrain from using this community as your personal blog. There is no need to share opinions or use this space as a diary for daydreams, thoughts, or subjective reflections.\n\n10) **No Investment Solicitation**  \nPosts about specific investments, such as cryptocurrency, are not permitted. Please refrain from soliciting, promoting, or offering any form of investment advice. There are other subreddits better suited for those discussions.\n\n***\n\nFlair Filters| [Want More?](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FEntrepreneur)\n---|---\n[Case Study](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Case+Study%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)| [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27AMA%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)\n[Startup Help](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Startup+Help%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)| [Tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Tools%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)\n[How Do I?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27How+Do+I%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)| [Investor Wanted](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Investor+Wanted%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)\n[Operations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Operations%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)| [Other](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Other%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)\n[Internship Offers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Internship+Offers%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)| [Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Recommendations%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)\n[Best Practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Best+Practices%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)| [Young Entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Young+Entrepreneur%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)\n[How to Grow](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27How+to+Grow%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)| [Lessons Learned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Lessons+Learned%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)\n[Feedback Please](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/search?q=flair%3A%27Feedback+Please%27&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all&amp;feature=legacy_search)| [Ask Mods for Other Flair.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FEntrepreneur)\n\n\n***\n\n##Our Weekly Sticky Posts\n\n**NooB Monday** - For the most basic of questions \n\n**Marketplace Tuesday** - Post jobs or internships you're looking to fill or about services you can offer\n\n**Wantrepreneur Wednesday** - Looking to ask a question a bit beyond the super basic but don't need a whole thread?

It’s also not for job-searching or recruitment: please use r/designjobs, r/forhire, r/jobs, or r/picrequests instead. You also cannot promote your own products, services, brand, or shop - including your design services.\n\n2. If posting someone else's work, credit them appropriately. If posting someone else's work, use the 'Someone Else's Work' flair. If posting your own work but it's been heavily inspired by, or has drawn on, elements of another person's design, you must credit them. Claiming someone else's work as your own will result in removal and repeated offenders will receive a ban.\n\n3. All shared work must have a comment for context. You must write a comment explaining any work that you post for feedback. The work’s objective, its audience, your design decisions, etc. This information is necessary to allow people to understand your project and provide feedback.\n\n4. No basic/repeated questions. Please Google your question first, and then use the search function on Reddit to see whether someone else has asked your question already. This also applies to font identification questions: use r/identifythisfont instead.\n\n5. This is not a “homework” forum. This is not a place to pick the brains of other designers to do your job for you. You can ask questions, or post asking for inspiration, but please don’t cross the line to getting other users to do your work for you.\n\n6. No off-topic/non-civil discussion. We recognise that design can be political and controversial. We welcome that content here, but please keep all discussion in the comments civil and focussed on the design. This rule also applies to responding to those who leave critical feedback – please give, and accept, feedback politely.\n\n7. No memes/low-quality posts. Please use r/designmemes instead. This also applies to \"meme\" work (non-serious work created as a joke).\n\n8. Is it suitable for this sub? To separate r/design from the various other creative industry subs, artwork and posts of pieces that have functional purpose should be submitted here. There's various other subs for /r/art, /r/DigitalArt, photoshop work, illustration etc. Artwork here must have been designed for a functional purpose",

You ask a question about starting, owning, and growing a small business and the community answers.  \n\nNO business promotion, lead generation, rants, info-tainment, success stories or unsolicited instructional texts, treatise, or how-to's are permitted in posts. \n\n**Note:** You can post own experiences in the *new* weekly stickied or pinned share-your-experience thread.  \n \n* **No blog links and blog content.**  \n\nBlogspam has been defined very early in r/smallbusiness as content that maybe text articles, images, or video. Practically all content, small business-related or not.\n   \n**Exceptions**  \nAllowed are links or quotes in comments and replies that are relevant to and come normally in the course of discussions.\n\n* **No business promotion posts.**   \n\nNo business promotion posts are allowed. Promote your business in the weekly Promote-your-business thread only. Offers of free services under the pretense of 'building your portfolio' are considered business promotion, and not permitted in posts.\n\n**Exceptions**\nYou can promote your business in a relevant reply to a post or comment in other threads providing that is not the main purpose of your account and it is not done repeatedly.\n\n* **No Personal Attacks, Trolling, or Toxicity.**   \n\n**Exceptions** None, no exceptions.\n\n* **Negative vote total posts may be removed**\n\nOverly broad posts may be removed if their vote total is negative and they are reported. For example: questions that ask subscribers for \"pain points\" or needs, about impossible hypotheticals, about what small business to start with $x (with no other info), and similar. You can avoid removal for this reason by searching r/smallbusiness and including indexed links to the same question asked here earlier. Questions showing signs of vote manipulation may also be subject to this rule.\n***************************************************\n\n**Related Subreddits**\n\n* [r/SmallBusinessNews](https://reddit.com/r/SmallBusinessNews/)  \n* [r/startups](http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/)  \n* [r/entrepreneur](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/)  \n* [r/business](http://www.reddit.com/r/business/)  \n* [r/IndieBiz](http://www.reddit.com/r/indiebiz/)  \n* [r/dotcom](http://www.reddit.com/r/dotcom/)\n* [r/advancedentrepreneur](http://www.reddit.com/r/advancedentrepreneur/)\n* [r/Bookkeeping](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bookkeeping/)\n* [r/growmybusiness](https://www.reddit.com/r/growmybusiness)\n* [r/TheBusinessGroup](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBusinessGroup)\n* [r/Emailmarketing](https://www.reddit.com/r/Emailmarketing) \n* [r/SellMyBusiness](https://www.reddit.com/r/SellMyBusiness)  \n\n***************************************************\n\n**Help With Your Small Business Network**\n\n* [r/techsupport](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport)  \n* [r/inventions](http://www.reddit.com/r/inventions)  \n* [r/ArtisanGifts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtisanGifts)\n* [/r/AdspaceMarket](https://www.reddit.com//r/AdspaceMarket) \n\n***************************************************\n\n\n**Location Specific Small Business Subreddit**\n\n* [/r/canadasmallbusiness](https://www.reddit.com/r/canadasmallbusiness)",

    "description": "*****\n\n#Wiki\n[FAQs, lessons, and resources](/r/startups/wiki/)\n  \n-----\n\n#About  \nWelcome to r/startups, a community for all backgrounds, levels of expertise, and business experience. \n####What is a startup?\nStartups are designed to scale/grow rapidly. Startups utilize tech to do this. Startups can be non-tech companies that utilize tech. Startups are information era companies and they are creating the new best practices in business.  \n\n####/r/startups \n\nWe share interesting discussions and stories about our startup journeys, both the failures, the successes, and the embarrassments. **Our best traits are authenticity and integrity.**\n\n----\n\n#Rules\n\n#####1.Relevant Content Only\n\nWe are a community of discussion based around startups, not traditional businesses.\n\nAll content must be relevant to startups.\n\nYou are welcome to ask how to apply startup methodologies to your traditional business if you frame your question in a non-promotional way. We want you to be able to ask any question that helps your startup.\n\n\n#####2.No direct sales, advertisements, or promotion\n\n**No direct sales, advertisements, or promotional posts of any kind**. We have designated places that are an exception to this rule and they will always be stickied at the top of /r/startups.\n\n* You MAY share your startup in the Share Your Startup thread\n\nSelf-promotion is anything you have an interest, stake or relationship with including being friends with someone at the company.\n\nAt the end of the day, /r/startups moderators have the final say if your comments are promotional or not.\n\n#####3.Submissions Serve a Specific Purpose\n\nSubmissions are for discussing methodologies, experiences, tactics, strategies, techniques, markets, and other such things WITHOUT tying them directly to your own project using its name or URL.\n\nTitles must be clear and descriptive.\n\nSubmissions must have at least 250 characters of content. The more details you provide us the better support our community can provide you with. Life life, the more you put into something the more you get out of it.\n\n#####4.Feedback Has a Place\n\nAll Feedback Requests (including surveys/polls) belong in our [Feedback Thread or other appropriate weekly thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/boq669/your_weekly_threads_guide_learn_about_the_new/)\n\nYou are invited to repost each week. \n\nBe sure to contribute to the others in the thread and ask them to return the favor to increase engagement.\n\nYou may not publicly offer feedback or direct support outside of the Stickied Threads.\n\n\n#####5.Rules for Links in Comments/Discussions\n\nSometimes you think the best solution is simply to link to a resource that might answer someone's question. We want you to be able to link in discussion to relevant content. We also don't want the discussion to turn into a self promotional mess and link farm.\n\nIf you are going to link to something in the comments please make sure to:\n\n* Write at least a sentence explaining why the link is relevant to the discussion.\n\n* Link only content you have no affiliation with. Affiliate links = banned.\n\n#####6.Do Not Solicit PM Requests\n\nThe purpose of making a submission or comment is to engage in a public discussion with the community. \n\nIt is not to request a message from someone. \n\nYou are more than welcome to engage privately with one another, but it is up to you to take the initiative directly.\n\n\n#####7.Sharing Your Blog is To Start a Discussion\n\nSharing your blog is not a means to self promote.\n\nA link to the original blog post is allowed with **prior** Mod approval.\n\nIf you are submitting your own blog content, the full body of the content must be included in the post, properly formatted for reddit.\n\nInclude an outline &amp; timestamps with a video.\n\nIf your blog is over 2000 words you may ask for an exemption.\n\nAll other rules still apply.\n\nNo blogs about your \"startup\" journey allowed.\n\n\n#####8.Always Be Kind and Supportive\n\nThe goal of this community is to encourage people to learn and be inspired to pursue ventures related to startups.\n\nDo not troll, harass people, or be an asshole. **This does not mean to lie. It means to give support and explain why you don't like something.**\n\nTry to remember people likely do not have much experience yet or might be simply ignorant to what you know.\n\nBe willing to hold a discussion and try to explain your opinion or point of view to the benefit of the entire community.\n\n\n\n#####9.No Unscheduled AMAs\n\nWe do not allow unscheduled AMAs.\n\nWe need to verify and approve all AMAs. \n\nIf you wish to do an AMA you must use the \"Message the Moderators\" feature in the side bar and you must give us at least TWO (2) Weeks Lead Time to organize it with you.\n\n----\n\n#Similar communities\n\n* /r/entrepreneur\n\n* /r/forhire \n\n* /r/kickstarter\n\n* /r/business\n\n* /r/hwstartups\n\n* /r/smallbusiness\n\n* /r/marketing\n\n* /r/sideproject\n\n* /r/growmybusiness\n\n* /r/shutdown (startup graveyard)\n\n* /r/venturedcapital  \n  \n* /r/AlphaAndBetaUsers (post your 'can you test my new product' posts here!)  \n  \n* /r/telecommuting (subreddit about remotely working)  \n  \n* *Want more?* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest)\n\n#Notable AMA's\n\n* [Emperor Alexis Ohanian](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/vfosl/iamalexis_ohanian_startup_founder_internet/)\n\n* [Founders of the Startup Institute](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1e30yq/were_the_founders_of_startup_institute_aaron/)\n\n* [Jaan Tallinn, Skype co-founder](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fuzwt/im_jaan_tallinn_cofounder_of_skype_kazaa_cser_and/)\n\n* [Imgur Founder](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/y81ju/i_created_imgur_ama/)\n\n* [Mozilla Contributer](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/120oif/we_are_mozilla_aua/)\n\n* [Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9s5k3/iama_i_am_a_highprofile_silicon_valley_venture/)\n\n----\n\n**[Previous Share your Startup threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+share+your+startup+self%3Ayes&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)**\n\n---\nNew to the scene?

Illegal activity will be removed. The flairs exist for general categorization. If you have an issue with a product/service from an institution, contact them first to resolve before posting here.\n\n2) **Be helpful and respectful**\n\nBe helpful and respectful in your comments. No need to insult degrade or be offensive to others. \n\n3) **Avoid Surveys and Self-promotion**\n\nThis includes solicitation of referrals, posting your own blog, video channel or personal website, surveys to gather data, and recommendations for users to do business with you. Do not ask others about their own personal circumstances e.g. \"what would you do\" and/or \"what are you doing for x?\" We expect that users do not use this forum to build a brand, for financial gain, or to attempt to gain traffic or users. This also extends to PM'ing users because of comments they made on this subreddit.\n\n4) **All specific investment recommendations/requests will be removed** \nCRYPTO RECOMMENDATIONS WILL ALWAYS BE REMOVED. Broad funds/ETFs, or discussion of investment concepts would still generally be allowed. Pushing particular investments without mentioning risk tolerance, timeline, use for the funds, etc, will be removed. Inquiries around specific funds and/or investment strategies should be directed to r/CanadianInvestor.\n\n5) **IamAs/AMAs must be approved by mods**\n\nIf you'd like to host an \"I Am A/Ask Me Anything\" (IamA/AMA) thread, you must first [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FPersonalFinanceCanada) for approval. We will evaluate if your topic is suitable for the subreddit and will set a date to avoid conflicts. Unapproved AMAs may be removed without notice at the moderator's discretion.\n\n6) **We expect that posts about crypto posted in this community PRIMARILY fit in with this community** Asking about Canada specific crypto taxation, rules, and other crypto topics would still be allowed, as the discussion resulting from it would be primarily Canada personal finance focused. CRYPTO RECOMMENDATIONS WILL ALWAYS BE REMOVED.\n\n####Posting guidelines\n\n**Include your province in your post!**\n\n**Include sources.**\n\nA good answer will be supported by relevant and reliable sources. Answers that link only to your personal blog or website are considered low-quality and may be removed at the moderators' discretion.\n\n**Have an in-depth answer.**\n\nUse a mix of context, explanation, and sources in your answer. Do not just post links to other sites as an answer. If you do believe a source fully answers a question then consider including a quote from the source. \n\n**Be inquisitive, and clear if you are unsure.**\n\nIf you have heard or read something which might be related to the question, and you want to check it, then make sure you ask it as a question. Do not post \"I'm not sure if this is true...\" or \"Someone will correct me if I'm wrong.\" If you're not actually answering the question, then make sure your comment looks like a question.\n\n####Wiki / Frequently asked questions\n\n[Reading list / recommended books](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/reading-list)\n\n[Step by step guide of what to prioritize / what to do with money](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/money-steps)\n\n[Frequently asked questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/faq)\n\n[**Wiki index with many more subjects**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/wiki/index)\n\n\n####Related subreddits\n\n/r/personalfinance\n\n/r/investing\n\n/r/CanTax\n\n/r/CanadianInvestor\n\n/r/FinancialIndependence\n\n/r/fican\n\n\n####Bot Triggers\n\nTrigger|Description\n---------|----------\n!StepsTrigger| Step by step list of what to do with money.\n!InvestingTrigger | Common questions that OP needs to answer in order to get proper advice about whether investing is appropriate for them.\n!CCTrigger | Common questions that OP needs to answer to get proper advice about recommending credit cards to them\n!MarginalTrigger | An example, using $15,000 of income and made up tax brackets, about how tax brackets work.

Posts or comments that do not contribute directly to a sales topic, or aren't generally viewed as sales-related, will be removed. Reading the rules of a sub/community is reddit common-sense-ethic 101, so remember to *read the rules for this sub before posting or commenting*! Failure to do so could result in moderator action(s), including a permanent ban.\n\n11. ###### No Memes\nMemes are not welcome on this sub. We understand the need for lighthearted discussions that lead to everyone having a better interaction, but memes fall closely under zero effort posts. Please, avoid posting any and all memes, OC or otherwise. An image with text superimposed is considered a meme, and is not acceptable. First violation is a 5-day ban, second violation is a permanent, indefinite ban.\n\n12. ###### No discord channels\nAny attempt to create, advertise or recruit to a discord channel will result in an immediate, permanent ban; *no exceptions*!\n\n**Auto-moderator is in effect**. Posts from accounts less than 24 hours old will be filtered out automatically. Message the moderators for approval if you are having issues.",

We have provided links below to other subreddits for that purpose. This rule is zero tolerance and breaking it will result in a ban.\n2. **Do not** submit low-effort posts essentially requesting free consulting (eg. \"please give me your ideas for my company's new logo\") More information about this rule [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/logodesign/comments/3fwcxh/new_subreddit_rule_in_regards_to_loweffort_posts/).\n3. **Do not** post links to crowd sourced or [spec work](http://www.nospec.com/faq) type design websites. Posts soliciting spec work are also strictly not allowed.\n4. **Do not** post memes, image macros, or social media screencaps.\n5. **Do not** share other people's private personal information.\n6. **Do not** spam the subreddit. This rule is also zero tolerance. *Yes, this includes YouTube channel spam.*\n7. **Do** be civil and respectful to others.\n8. **Read** [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) &amp; [self promotion](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).\n9. **Asking for feedback** All posts requesting feedback should include some information about what the client is seeking. For questions, click the link below.\n\nDesign is solving a problem, and in order to give correct critique, we'll need to know what the logo is supposed to accomplish. Don't include specific client contact info, just put some direction the client has included in the brief. If they don't give you any information, you shouldn't be creating a logo for them.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/logodesign/s/fQvDGruD25\n\n10. **Add Flair** for Posting - Please choose a flair before uploading the post. Beginner is for novice designers, Client Work is for when posting feedback to meet the approval of a client, and Practice is just for fun and exploring.\n\n*Not being aware of these rules does not exempt posters from being required to follow them.*\n\nIf you need something designed, consider posting your request in the following helpful subreddits instead:\n\n* [r/ForHire](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire)\n* [r/DesignJobs](http://www.reddit.com/r/DesignJobs)\n* [r/LogoRequests](http://www.reddit.com/r/LogoRequests)\n* [r/PhotoshopRequest](http://www.reddit.com/r/PhotoshopRequest)\n* [r/PicRequests](http://www.reddit.com/r/PicRequests)\n\nOtherwise, anything related to logos is welcome.

We welcome a broad range of topics on the front page, from news about specific firms, to working in consulting, to industry happenings, to lifestyle, to career planning (for existing consultants). Jobseekers and those learning about the industry are welcome, but should use the appropriate megathreads instead of the front page.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Posting Guideline Highlights**\n\n**Rule 0.** All Reddit rules apply.\n\n**Rule 1.** Posts should be relevant to consulting or to consultants.

(NO LINKS TO THE HOMEPAGE OF CLICKBANK OR JVZOO OR SIMILAR NETWORK. MUST LINK TO A SPECIFIC PRODUCT OR OPPORTUNITY.  All offers that violate this will be removed and the user banned.\n\n1. Inserting links in posts and comments.\n*Any links not part of a larger discussion (i.e., blatant attempts to farm backlinks) will be removed as will links where we cannot tell if there is a tracking code. \n*Links to websites or blogs containing a sales page/sign up will be removed. \n*Links to \"Guru's\" or high priced coaching programs will be removed. (and the community will hate you;) \n*Links to tools must be in the sticky thread for offers. Want to recommend something as part of a discussion? Great. Use the name, not the link. \n\n1. This community is intended solely for ethical online promotion techniques. That said, ^let's ^talk ^^black ^^hat ^^^tactics ^^^too\n\n1. No babysitting posts. Wanna learn how to get started?

Please downvote roasts that you think have nothing to do with the actual product.\n\n4- Please report comments that are malicious or tasteless.\n\n5- Be harsh but be accurate. People didn't post here looking for compliments.\n\n6- You can ONLY roast the start-up or product. Do NOT make personal hateful attacks against the person posting.",
