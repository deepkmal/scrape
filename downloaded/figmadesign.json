    "selftext": "**TLDR:** Even if you pay for the Professional plan for yourself, you won't be able to use the Dev Mode. To get the same experience for free, export a Figma file and import it into Pixso, Penpot, or any other tool.\n\n**Full Story:** I'm a front-end developer working with multiple clients. Designers usually send me designs in Figma.\n\nYesterday, I decided to pay for the Professional plan to access Dev Mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hjmxtbpgqjgc1.png?width=1214&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e792183d14f5187d807856481186d8ae20d8cc9e\n\nOnce I signed up for a plan, I noticed that I couldn't use the Dev Mode on most projects I work with.\n\nThere was an error telling me that I was not a member of the team:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3w04aimqjgc1.png?width=352&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3def48367dae216e9c19222866440f07e005b42\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay. I asked the designer to add me as a member of his team, but I still can't use the advertised Dev Mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rksbvqbrqjgc1.png?width=405&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00dc20def63fa972134c890f8e071239616f35ad\n\nSo, I would need to ask the designer to pay for an additional seat ($15/mo) to allow me to use it in the Dev Mode, which I have paid for already.\n\nThat's called a scam.\n\nTechnically, I can export the design as a FIG file and import it under my team, but in this case, I had to re-import the design to sync the changes. Also, there will be no comments, notes, and other important features.\n\nFrom this perspective, it will be easier to use [Pixso](https://pixso.net/) this way. I also need to import the Figma design, but I have access to Pixso's Dev Mode for free. Penpot is also pretty good and completely free, but the Figma import is not perfect.\n\nAs an EU resident, I have canceled my plan and requested a refund.\n\nSo if you're a freelancer, independent contractor, or an employee in a small company, don't make my mistake and do not purchase Dev Mode. It's mostly useless.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, the way how Figma sells its services can be considered a scam. The [EU Directive on consumer rights](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/contract-information/index_en.htm) requires the seller to provide a customer with **clear, correct and understandable information** about the product or service before purchase.\n\nFigma deliberately did not include this information on the [Pricing page](https://www.figma.com/pricing/), on the [Pricing FAQ page](https://www.figma.com/pricing-faq/), or during the checkout.\n\nSo yes, \"scam\" is the correct word to describe the situation.\n\nI hope my experience will be useful to you and you won't pay for the service you can't use.",

Their criteria was to create a hero section inspired by the trending Neomorphic UI style, dark backgrounds, gradients, subtle 3D elements, and realistic lighting. I figured it was a test to see how well I could handle color gradients, lighting, and how I manipulate visual depth.\n\nSo I had a bold idea: if that's what they wanted to evaluate, why not push it to the max? I decided to go all in and design a hero section themed around *light* itself. I took about an hour and built the entire section from scratch. Everything you see in the image was illustrated by me in Figma.\n\nSpoiler: they didn’t hire me.\n\nTheir feedback? They said I should’ve used an AI-generated image for the header, which would’ve looked better. They also said my choice of fonts was “not good,” and that the button on the right side of the top nav was “too basic.”\n\nIn hindsight, if I had just made a design that mimicked the reference they gave—which would’ve taken half the effort, I probably would’ve had a better shot at getting hired. Maybe this is a lesson for me: not to overdeliver when it’s not asked for, and just follow the brief.\n\nAnyway, I’d really appreciate some honest feedback. Does this design hold any merit, or am I just too full of myself?",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I wanted to prototype iOS 18 app flows in Figma — especially app launch — but couldn’t find a kit with native-style animations.   \n  \nSo I made my own: [https://www.figma.com/community/file/1494071623063957463/ios-18-interactive-ui-kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1494071623063957463/ios-18-interactive-ui-kit)\n\n**What i've included:**\n\n1. Unlock screen\n2. App launch animation\n3. Simple app switching\n4. Interactive keyboard\n5. Two-level context menus with animations\n\nAll built with Smart Animate — no plugins.\n\nSharing it just in case it’s helpful for quick demos, user tests — or if you’re curious how these iOS-like animations can be built in Figma.\n\nTook a while to get the animations smooth — hope it’s useful!",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone, \n\nI work on fairly complex projects in figma and my page list often ends up looking like a never ending scroll of chaos. Right now, the only way i found to \"organize\" is by adding separators or emojis but it's still a flat structure.\n\nLike collapsing the pages and open them when you need them to show up only. I think it would be one of the most useful small feature to add. \n\nI know some people use multiple Figma files to separate work but it's not always practical, especially when everything belongs to the same big software project. \n\nDoes anyone else feel the same or maybe there s a hack i'm missing ?

The simplicity of the old ones with just the arrows were more than enough to get the point across. I see what they were going for with showing the result of how your objects will layout but they sort of make me second guess what I'm clicking on since they all look like a cluster of squares. \n\nNot a huge annoyance obviously but just something I notice whenever I'm using autolayout lately. Seems like sometimes they change stuff just for the sake of doing something different rather than just sticking to what works.",
