    "selftext": "About 70 days ago, I shared a post here about our AdSense account being suspended because of an alleged “association” with a disabled account. We manage a big YouTube channel with over 2 million subscribers, so this hit hard.\n\nAfter 3–4 months of getting nowhere with AdSense support, just the same generic replies, we reached out to around 50 lawyers. Most of them said there was nothing we could do because “it’s Google.” One lawyer finally agreed to help. We shared all the research we had gathered from similar cases, and he found some potential contract breaches. He helped us send a legal letter, first to Google in the US, then again to Ireland after they redirected us. Nearly two months later, the account was reinstated.\n\nTo those who said legal action was a waste of time I understand the doubt, but if you’re not sure how these things actually work, please don’t discourage others with false info. And thanks to the Google team for eventually reviewing the case and doing the right thing.",

    "selftext": "Hey folks, we recently launched a tool called [**Adreport.io**](http://Adreport.io) to make it easier to monitor and report across multiple ad accounts. Right now, it supports **Google Ads** and **Meta Ads**, with a clean, mobile-friendly UI so you can check performance without opening five tabs and losing your mind.\n\nIt’s live, it’s usable, but before we blindly build 200 features nobody asked for, we’d love some honest feedback.\n\nHere’s what we’re thinking next. What’s actually worth building?\n\n* **More integrations**: LinkedIn, TikTok, Reddit, GA, Microsoft Ads, Amazon, Taboola\n* **Anomaly alerts**: “Hey, your CPC just spiked 70% overnight.”\n* **AI insights**: “This campaign’s mobile CTR fell off a cliff” kind of stuff\n* **Mobile apps**: because yes, we all check performance at 2 am\n\nWould love to know:  \n👉 What’s missing?  \n👉 What would actually save you time (or sanity)?  \n👉 What would make this not another tool that collects dust after sign-up?\n\n**Update (July 10 2025)**\n\n* **Automatic result detection is live.** Adreport now identifies the key result for 95 percent-plus of Google Ads and Meta campaign setups, so you never have to map goals by hand.\n* **Website analytics coming soon.** Many of you asked for traffic data alongside ad metrics. We’ve started the Google Analytics (GA4) integration, and you’ll be able to see site-side numbers in Adreport by August.\n* Found an edge case we missed? Drop it below and we’ll add it to our fast-track fix queue.\n\nThanks for helping us build what actually matters. Keep the feedback rolling!",

Greed is a crazy thing because Google didn’t even warn site owners that this change would cause such an impact on the dashboard and the way revenue is earned. I truly believe this was a bad idea and Google knew it was. They did the change without thinking of publishers but did the change thinking about what would benefit their company the most.

It didn’t. After 6 rejections, Reddit helped me realize what Google actually wants:\n\n* **Privacy Policy, Terms, Contact, About Pages**\n* **Cookies consent banner**\n* **Original blog content** (multiple posts)\n\n# The Fix!\n\nI added the missing pages, wrote 8 unique blog posts about Brawl Stars events and analytics, installed a cookies popup, and submitted again.\n\nThis morning, after 6 unsuccessful attempts over several months... **AdSense approved!!**\n\n# The Lesson A Noob (Me) Learned\n\nTraffic alone isn’t enough. I needed:\n\n1. Legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms, Contact, About (I think this 'about' is optional) Pages)\n2. Cookies consent\n3. Multiple original blogs\n\nGOOD LUCK AND I HOPE THIS HELPED!",

    "selftext": "Getting approved by Google AdSense often feels confusing—especially when you’ve followed all the standard advice: quality posts, required pages, clean design, and still… rejection.\n\nThis post is based on a **real conversation between two website owners**, one of whom successfully runs multiple AdSense-approved WordPress sites. The insights here are practical, honest, and experience-driven.\n\n# 1. The Basic Requirements Are Necessary — But Not Sufficient\n\nMost bloggers already know the checklist:\n\n* A reasonable library of blog posts\n* Clear **categories**\n* Essential pages:\n   * About Us\n   * Contact\n   * Privacy Policy\n   * Terms &amp; Conditions\n   * Disclaimer\n\n👉 Google itself confirms these expectations in its publisher guidelines:  \n🔗 [https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9724](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9724)\n\nHowever, **having these pages alone does not guarantee approval**.\n\n# 2. “Low-Value Content” Is the Most Common Silent Killer\n\nOne of the most frustrating rejection reasons is:\n\n&gt;\n\nThis often happens even when:\n\n* Articles are 800–1500 words long\n* Grammar is correct\n* The niche is educational (tutorials, software testing, etc.)\n\n# Why this happens:\n\n* Content covers topics already **saturated** on the web\n* Articles are **generic**, rewritten versions of existing tutorials\n* No original perspective, experience, or differentiation\n\nEven ranking on **page 70–80 of Google** can signal to AdSense that your content isn’t adding new value.\n\n📌 **Important insight:**\n\n&gt;\n\n# 3. Is AI-Generated Content the Reason for Rejection?\n\nShort answer: **No.**\n\nAI-generated content alone is **not a violation** of AdSense policies.\n\nGoogle’s official stance focuses on **content quality**, not the tool used to create it:  \n🔗 [https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content)\n\n# Real-world proof:\n\n* Many AdSense-approved sites use **ChatGPT**\n* Some site owners even **disclose AI usage in the footer**\n* Approval still happens\n\n📌 The deciding factor is **whether the content helps users**, not whether it was written by a human or AI.\n\n# 4. Repeated Rejections Don’t Mean the Site Is “Blacklisted”\n\nA key takeaway from the conversation:\n\n&gt;\n\nYes—this happens more often than people admit.\n\n# Why?\n\n* AdSense reviews are partially **human-moderated**\n* Different reviewers may interpret quality differently\n* Minor site changes + time explain many approvals\n\n📌 Tip:  \nIf your site is clean and policy-compliant, **reapply after 2–4 weeks** instead of abandoning it.\n\n# 5. High-Risk Niches That Face Tougher Scrutiny\n\nEven well-written sites struggle if they fall into sensitive categories:\n\n* Finance (stocks, trading, crypto)\n* Medical or health advice\n* Quiz-based sites\n* Thin tutorial aggregation sites\n\nAdSense applies **stricter quality thresholds** in these niches.\n\n🔗 AdSense program policies:  \n[https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182)\n\n# 6. Ads Without AdSense: How Some Sites Monetize Anyway\n\nYou might notice ads on sites that are **not AdSense-approved**.\n\nThese are usually:\n\n* Affiliate banners\n* Contextual product links\n* In-content recommendations\n\n# Popular Affiliate Marketplaces:\n\n* 🔗 [https://impact.com](https://impact.com/)\n* 🔗 [https://www.cj.com](https://www.cj.com/)\n* 🔗 [https://partnerstack.com](https://partnerstack.com/)\n* 🔗 [https://rakutenadvertising.com](https://rakutenadvertising.com/)\n* 🔗 [https://www.awin.com](https://www.awin.com/)\n\n# In-house Affiliate Programs:\n\n* Cloudways\n* Kinsta\n* IONOS\n* SendPulse\n\nAffiliate monetization is:\n\n* Easier to start\n* Allowed even before AdSense approval\n* Often more profitable for niche blogs\n\n# 7. Practical Advice Before Starting a New Blog\n\nIf you’re planning to start again:\n\n✅ Choose a niche where **personal insight** matters  \n✅ Add **examples, screenshots, workflows, opinions**  \n✅ Avoid mass-produced tutorial angles  \n✅ Build slowly and apply after publishing **10–20 strong posts**  \n✅ Use AI as an **assistant**, not a content factory\n\n# Final Thought\n\nAdSense approval is **not a moral judgment** on your effort or intelligence.  \nIt’s a combination of:\n\n* Content differentiation\n* Perceived usefulness\n* Reviewer interpretation\n* Timing and persistence\n\nMany approved publishers today were **rejected multiple times** before succeeding.\n\nSometimes, the real strategy is simple:\n\n&gt;\n\n",

I have auto ads on, and when I use the AdSense simulator it suggests there should be an average of 8 ads per page.

    "selftext": "\n\nUpdates to how publishers monetize with AdSense\nNov 02, 2023\n\n\nAdSense is updating its revenue share-structure and moving to per-impression payments for publishers.\n\n\nTwenty years ago, we built Google AdSense to help publishers of all sizes make money from their websites. Our easy-to-use ad network simplified digital advertising, connecting publishers with advertisers around the world to sell their ad space. And now, every year, we pay out billions of dollars to the publishing partners in our ad network. This allows content creators to spend more time doing what they do best: creating great content.\n\nAs the advertising industry has evolved, so have the monetization choices available to publishers. Today, website owners use a combination of direct sales, ad networks and sell-side platforms to sell their ad space, often using multiple technologies simultaneously.\n\nThis is why we are making two changes: updating AdSense’s revenue-share structure and moving to paying publishers by impression. These changes will provide a consistent way for publishers to compare the differing fees across the various technologies they use to monetize and will provide even greater transparency into the media-buying process.\n\nBased on our tests, we don’t expect publishers to see a change in their earnings as a result of these updates.\n\nUpdating the AdSense revenue share structure\nFor years, AdSense has been transparent about the fee we charge for our service, which is consistent with industry rates. When publishers have chosen to use AdSense to monetize their content, they have kept 68% of the revenue.\n\nPreviously, the Google AdSense network processed fees within a single transaction. We are now splitting the AdSense revenue share into separate rates for the buy-side and sell-side. For displaying ads with AdSense for content, publishers will receive 80% of the revenue after the advertiser platform takes its fee, whether that be Google’s buy-side or third-party platforms.\n\nFor example, when Google Ads purchases display ads on AdSense, Google Ads will retain on average 15% of advertiser spend. There are variations because Google Ads does not take a fixed, per-impression fee, as many advertisers choose to pay based on user actions, like a click or conversion. Overall, publishers will continue to keep about 68% of the revenue.\n\nWhen advertisers use a third-party platform to purchase display ads on AdSense, publishers will keep 80% of the revenue after the third-party platform has taken its fee. Google does not control or have visibility into the fees that these third-party platforms charge advertisers or how they calculate them.\n\nImage showing how one dollar from an advertiser becomes sixty eight cents after buy and sell-side fees\nMoving to per-impression payments for publishers\nIn addition to updating our revenue-share structure, AdSense will soon transition from primarily paying publishers per click to the display industry standard of paying per impression. This update will provide a more uniform way for paying publishers for their ad space across Google’s products and third-party platforms, helping them compare with other technology providers they use.\n\nIt’s important to note that this change will not influence the type or quantity of ads publishers can display on their websites. Publishers in our ad network are required to adhere to both our AdSense policies and the Better Ads Standards which do not allow practices like pop-ups or interruptive ads that take up the majority of the screen.\n\nWe expect these updates to go into effect early next year. These changes do not require any action from publishers.\n\nAdvertising technology helps fund the creative and diverse content we all enjoy online. That’s why we’ve spent years investing in AdSense to help publishers of all sizes easily make money and grow. As the internet evolves, we will continue our work to contribute to the open web and the access to content that advertising supports, while continuing to simplify and provide transparency into the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall it looks like we will earn less.... \nclicks always pay more than impressions",

Now, I’ve crossed my first dollar, and while it may seem small to some, to me, it’s a significant milestone.\n\nI believe this is just the beginning, and I’m eager to keep improving. For those with experience, I’d love your advice: **What strategies can I implement to increase revenue and grow my blog sustainably?**",

It's my passion and all my work and it's all up in the air thanks to AdSense making a HUGE mistake.\n\nHad an email from AdSense and YouTube saying all my monetizations had been cancelled at 1:30am PST.\n\nAdSense said this: \"Our specialists have found that your account is related to an account that was disabled for violations of AdSense policies\"\n\nWhat is scary is I've never ever had an account that has been disabled. It's also quite shocking how they do this with zero warning.\n\nI think this happened because it's a business AdSense account, and it shares the address with many other businesses it's possible somebody else's account was disabled and because of their stupid systems that do these checks disabled mine thinking it was related. The reason I say this is because when I created the account I got a duplicate account error for somebody else's account. I proved I wasn't them and all got resolved with YouTube support.\n\nI can't even appeal it as I constantly get an error bounceback email. I've reached out to creator support bot army and escalated to a manager who is hopefully a real person but really I have no hope as creator support has been really bad for me in the past apart from once resolving that duplicate account error.\n\nHas anybody had or ever had this happen?

    "title": "How I Got Accepted into AdSense After Multiple Rejections - Tips for Squarespace Recipe Websites",
    "selftext": "This is for everyone out there feeling super discouraged with AdSense rejections. \n\nIf you've been pouring your heart into your blog, only to hit a wall, you're not alone. It's frustrating after months of hard work to feel ready for monetization, then be turned down. \n\nIt's even more disheartening when you search for help and answers, only to find statistics suggesting that over 90% of sites face rejection. What's even worse is to find out that if you have a recipe website your chances are slim to none because it's such a saturated niche.\n\nI'm sharing my story here to break the negative narrative. This post isn’t just for Squarespace or recipe websites either, I’m sure it could be helpful for anyone. \n\nSo if you’re struggling with this, I hope you find this post to get some hope and inspiration from my experience.\n\n**Let Me Introduce Myself and Blog**\n\n* I’m a professional chef who after many tough years running a restaurant with my husband (which we didn’t own), left the restaurant industry and took a break to travel in 2023.\n* During our travels, we realized we wanted to maintain our freedom and explore income streams not tied to physical labor.\n* I saw an opportunity in recipe development for food websites but soon realized I lacked online experience and a social media presence. \n* I started setting up my food blog on Squarespace in June 2023 with the main goal of creating an online portfolio and getting my name out there. I also had the hope of eventually monetizing with ads, affiliate marketing, digital products, and a YouTube channel.\n* The website officially went live in November 2023 and currently has 36 posts - mostly recipes with some informational articles as well.\n* Right now it’s averaging 3,000 pageviews per month, with significant traffic starting in April 2024.\n* Most of my traffic comes from organic Google searches and Google Discover (a very tiny amount comes from Pinterest).\n* I have 13 pages featured on Google Discover, and several recipes and articles are ranking in the top 10, with one article ranking first in Google search results.\n* I’ve done my own research and spent zero money on courses or tools, only spending money on running the Squarespace site.\n* I’ve optimized for SEO with relevant keywords, correct heading structure, recipe schema markup on every post, and high-quality images with titles and alt text (min 1200 pixels wide and no larger than 500kb).\n* I have an about page that describes my journey, ensuring links from every page lead back to it with my photo and a brief description to help build credibility (authoritativeness).\n* I'm on Instagram, Pinterest, Reddit, and Trivet.recipes, but I'm just starting out with zero followers and haven’t really built up my social media presence yet.\n\n**First Adsense Application and Rejection “Program Policy Issues”**\n\n* Applied for Adsense on May 2nd and received a rejection on May 7th due to “program policy issues”.\n* Initially, I used a privacy policy copied from a free website. I didn’t have terms and conditions, disclaimers, and an opt-out option in my cookie banner - so I thought this could be the main problem.\n* To fix these issues, I revised the privacy policy, created terms and conditions with a legal disclaimer, and updated the cookie banner to include an opt-in or out option with a link to the privacy policy.\n* I looked at privacy policies from successful recipe blogs to ensure mine was up to standard, read Squarespace’s privacy policy guide, and customized segments with help from ChatGPT.\n* My husband read and edited the policies to make sure they were clear and understandable for regular humans.\n\n**Second Application and Rejection “Navigation Issues”**\n\n* Applied again on May 14th and received a rejection less than 24 hours later due to “navigation issues”. I was glad that at least this time it wasn’t a vague \"program policy issues\" rejection.\n* Made improvements by adding dropdown menus to the main navigation and making it sticky (disappears on scroll down, reappears on scroll up).\n* Added a recipe index page with summary blocks categorized by recipe types.\n* Improved the footer with navigation links and added a convenient back-to-top button.\n* Added custom code to display a breadcrumb at the top of the main blog pages to show which recipe or article category you’re in (if you choose one).\n\n**Third Application and Rejection “Low-Value Content”**\n\n* I re-applied on May 16th and was rejected again less than 24 hours later for “low-value” content. This one kind of hurt a little because I was proud of my work and wasn’t sure where to start with fixing this. \n* With a little help from ChatGPT, I reviewed my recipes and identified some issues.\n* Found repetitive content in detailed step-by-step instructions and summary sections, sometimes with exact verbatim repetition.\n* Discovered one article with an embedded YouTube video that wasn’t my own content, although I thought it was helpful for readers.\n* Some articles were shorter than 800 words (some people say this is a must, although Google doesn’t specifically require it).\n* Implemented changes by revising the summary sections with different titles, shorter instructions, alternate hooks, added a brief top tips section, a call to action, related content links, and a button to jump back to detailed steps with photos.\n* Made sure all articles were at least 800 words and added more questions and answers to improve usefulness.\n* Made sure there were lots of relevant internal links within each post. Replaced the embedded video with a text link and described its content in my own words instead.\n* Published more recipes to reach a total of 35 posts, up from 30 at the time of the third application.\n\n**Finally, I was Accepted!**\n\n* I applied again on June 3rd and was accepted on June 5th!\n* This time, the fact that I didn't receive a rejection within 24 hours gave me some hope.\n* Since then I’ve added the ad code and figured out how to fix the ads.txt issue with Squarespace (read this [article](https://www.graesen.com/blog/resolve-google-adsense-your-earnings-may-be-at-risk-error-for-squarespace) - it worked for me).\n* After one week of running ads on the site, I’ve earned $1. It might not seem like much, but it’s so validating, especially since AdSense is often said to be the \"easiest\" ad program to join. The site is still growing, and every bit of progress counts.\n\n**The Takeaway**\n\nSo if you’re feeling discouraged, particularly if it’s a recipe website and you're on Squarespace, DON’T GIVE UP!\n\nThere’s a lot of negative information out there about using Squarespace and running ads. Everyone seems to recommend WordPress, making it hard to find examples of successfully ad-monetized Squarespace sites.\n\nBut I managed to build my website quickly and easily on Squarespace, I think it looks really modern and nice, and I’ve grown traffic and implemented ads. It IS possible! \n\nI’m planning to stick it out with Squarespace and eventually create detailed, step-by-step content on how I did everything with Squarespace.\n\nIf you guys have any questions I’d be happy to help, also if you want to have a look at my site you can check it out here: [onecreativecook.com](http://www.onecreativecook.com).\n\nI really hope this helps. I wish you all the very best of luck!",

I was creating content focusing on making money with adsense, but the site didn't approve it for anything. I thought the reason for the rejections would be because of the articles created by AI and humanized by me. However, I started analyzing articles from large portals using AI and monetized with adsense, I realized that the content could even influence disapproval, but it wasn't a rule. I submitted it and was rejected again. I decided to do an in-depth analysis of the site, it already had more than 200 articles and I reviewed everything, pages, themes, appearance, articles, pagespeed, etc. I sent it and was rejected again, I was already giving up and stopped looking for errors. I continued creating articles with AI and, one fine day, it “approved”. You will understand Google and its rules! In short, send and beat them out of fatigue!",

    "selftext": "A majority part of my income comes from my blogs. And once you figure out the individual steps and parts, you can create a workflow that doesn't demand too much of your time everyday.\n\nI mainly drive traffic from pinterest now. Much easier than ranking on google.\n\nSo these are the steps I am following, and you can follow to (hopefully) get similar or better results. \n\n**Step 1: The Usuals With A Twist**\n\nWe’ll start with everything usual, I am not going to bore you with details.\n\nChoose a niche, make the website (preferably with Wordpress if you are non-techy), make sure all the technical stuff are ok. use a clean, professional theme.  Doesn’t need to be premium.\n\nFree Kadence theme works great!  But one important thing about niche. It needs to be something that works on pinterest. Visual, Image heavy, Idea centric. Example: nail art ideas, home decor ideas, backyard designs, etc etc. \n\n**Step 2: Research For Content Ideas**\n\nThere are 2 ways. Free and paid. Like most things in life, free works but time-consuming and limited data. If you are just starting out, don't worry about it. \n\nGo to pinterest, search around with your niche topic, find ideas that aren't too saturated. Dont get stuck on keywords, we are finding content ideas, not a single keyword.\n\nOne content idea can support many keywords.  Suppose if my niche is hairstyle, I might search hairstyle &gt; then find men's hairstyle (too saturated), then find men short hairstyle (still saturated), then find men over 40 short hairstyle (perfect).\n\nBy the way, this is just a fake scenario, i didn't actually search on pinterest. \n\nThe whole process gets a lot easier and less time consuming if you use PinClicks ([pinclicks.com](https://www.pinclicks.com/)). PinClicks has a lot of data, lots more features so you can quickly find content ideas. This is not a PinClicks tutorial so I am not going any more deep. \n\n**Step 3: Content Creation**\n\nNow we'll start creating the content. Suppose my topic is short hairstyle for men over 40.  First, I'll craft a good title, give a good intro. Then I'll go straight on to the hairstyle ideas.  I said before, pinterest is heavy on images. so we need to create image heavy content more.\n\nTarget 7 to 10 images for each content.  You can either create the images using AI (give disclaimer they are ai, people don't mind much in my experience) or curate them from Social Media Posts. \n\nSuppose I found an instagram post with a good image that goes with my topic. I'll use that image in the post and give proper credit to the user with the user's profile link in the caption.\n\nIf you attribute properly, people don't mind generally.  IMPORTANT FOR AI IMAGES: If you are using AI images, you need to clean them first so pinterest doesn't tag them as AI. I use a free tool called AI Metadata Cleaner ([aimetadatacleaner.com](https://aimetadatacleaner.com/)). DISCLAIMER: THIS IS MY OWN TOOL, I BUILT IT! \n\n**Step 4: Publish To Pinterest**\n\nAfter you publish each content, take the images, and schedule them out to your pinterest account. You'll find keywords for each content idea during the research phase. Use those keywords to craft pin title and description pairs. \n\nNever publish all the pins at once. schedule them out. Use pinterest native scheduler.  Also, make some pins with text overlays, collage images with text overlays that promises the pinterest user something, and asks for a click. \n\nSuppose I have a pin of hairstyle image collage, with a text overlay \"10+ Short Hairstyle Ideas Men Over 40 Are Going Crazy For\" then it has a hook for the readers, promise them there are hairstyle ideas here and urge them to click to the post. \n\n**Step 5: Rinse 'n Repeat**\n\nNow do another post. 2-3 Posts a week. Schedule the pins out with enough space between them. Hopefully by 2-3 months you'll start to see traffic pouring in. \n\nOnce you have the traffic, there are many ways to monetize that. Ads are the most popular. Some good choices for small sites (&lt; 10k pageviews) are: Adsense, Journey by mediavine ([journeymv.com](http://journeymv.com/)).\n\nIf you have any question, let me know! ",

    "selftext": "I've been blogging since 2012. My aim is to be able to earn at least $1000 per month because that's what I need to have some semblance of financial security i.e., even if I lost my job, my family can still eat without drowning in debts.\n\nHowever, 10 years forward and I cannot find any pattern that I am actually moving closer to this goal. At my best, I was earning $100 every eight months. Then, the pandemic hit and it affected my site visits, causing me to earn $100 only every 16 months.\n\nAdmittedly, I'm not really posting regularly due to being busy with job and real life situation. I currently have two active blogs.\n\n* One has 300 posts, but most of these posts are less than 500 words in length and are about the buildings here in my city. It earns more than four times the blog below.\n* The other blog is about instructional design, elearning. and education (I'm a teacher by profession and currently working as elearning developer). It has 99 posts but each is at least 800 words long, with some even reaching 2000.\n\nNow, I know of a number of posts or number of words per posts is usually not sufficient indicator of how much I can earn from adsense, but **assuming that I did everything else in a suboptimal manner, is it possible to reach my goal of $1000 per month? Is there an amount of content that can accomplish this?**  \n\n\nThings I've already done:\n\n* Content is mostly text, e.g., no infographics and minimal text info in graphics\n* Optimized title header, e.g., putting a slightly different version of the post title to capture alternative keywords that visitors might use in search\n* Optimized website template, e.g., minimal CSS or Javascript within the page, and common page elements such as navigations come last\n* Put up Adsense code.\n\nThings I'm willing to do:\n\n* Post regularly. I am not sure how often, but I am willing to increase the frequency of my post provided that there is indeed a certain number or amount of content I can target to reach $1000 per month.  \n\nThings I might consider but I'm not quite convinced of its benefits:\n\n* Putting up mailing list.\n\nThings I am not considering doing.\n\n* Paying for SEO. I rather learn it. I already know a few techniques but I am not sure if they are enough.\n* Looking for alternative monetization other than Adsense. I might consider them later if I want to further increase my income but only after I reach $1000 per month.\n* Revise or edit blog posts so they have certain keyword density. I want to write and edit for humans, not for search engines.\n* Write content about something that has nothing to do with my target niche only because it is \"trending\".\n* Write content designed to be \"viral\" and manipulate people into distributing it.\n* Create content that involves revealing personal aspects of my life or drawing attention to myself, like what many \"social media influencers\" are doing nowadays. I only want financial security. I don't want to be popular.\n\nSo is this a feasible endeavor? Or is my time better used for something else, such as focusing on full time job and freelancing?  \n\n\nThank you very much my friends.",

I got 100s of edits that i needed to do 😅. I went through the feedback and made a list of the main reoccurring points which i thought as valid, they were as follows:\n\n•**Imprint of ownership** \\- Someone stated i needed to add imprint of ownership of the website, so i added that to the websites contact page.\n\n• **Fix Mobile &amp; Tablet Menu** \\- The heading Menu had ended up breaking while i was probably doing edits to the website and all the menu options were in one line, so it was practically useless, So i fixed that.\n\n• **Carousel of Featured Posts** \\- this was a visual change, but i agreed with the commentor and ended up replacing it with a better option.\n\n• **Website Images** – All the images on my website were ones i got from google which was a copyright issue and people recommended me to use stock images, but i preferred AI Images because they are more unique and it was easier for me to make them and add credits rather than finding images from stock images that matches my style and were relevant to the content. I checked online and it stated AI Images are allowed so i took the risk. I added a lot more pictures to the blogs like 3 to 4 per blog now so it looks visually better.\n\n• **Schedule Posts** \\- Since i worked in batches i would post like 6 to 8 blogs in one day which is not good which i now know 😅, so for now i changed the dates of the old blogs and will schedule them moving forward.\n\n• **Search Page and Category Page** \\- I hadn't added categories to the blogs, so i did that and i had to fix the search and category pages as they were broken and unreadable.\n\n• **Index all pages** \\- I Indexed all the pages at the end. idk how there were like 20 pages which were un-indexed even do i indexed all the posts as i posted them, due to the 10 index my day left i had to wait a few days to index them all.\n\n• **Content** \\- Since i was going for for Quantity over Quality, people pointed out the posts were low quality so i had to go through them and manually fix each one, i tried to increase the Quality as much as i can quickly. There were some really bad posts so i just archived them for now and ill fix them later.\n\n• **Improve Blog Titles** \\- The Blog Titles weren't that good so i made them a bit better, i was working fast so i just made do for now.\n\n• **Internal Linking** \\- I linked blogs to other one with similar topics.\n\n• **Increase Font size** \\- Some people said the Blogs Text size was too small but i didn't have time to edit all of them so for the future posts ill use a larger text, this was more of a visual update so it should be fine for google ads.\n\nSo I did all of these edits, it took me working non-stop for numerous days, and on 15th March i applied for google ads again. \n\nHoping to get Accepted this time!",

    "selftext": "In March '23, a small and relatively harmless website I created to provide information started to attract tens of thousands of hits a month. I quickly monetised the website with Adsense, which brought in around £100 a month. A nice bonus from a site with only a dozen pages and no real effort.\n\nThat is until around September, when a gent enquired about purchasing the site from me. I replied asking for £3,000 - which seemed fair at the time. I received an angry response from the gent, who threatened to create his own competing site. I ignored him and moved on.\n\nI notice over the next couple of months that around 10% of my traffic is being syphoned away - it appears this gent went through with his promise and created almost a dozen websites with similar URLs and ripped-off GPT content. Aside from some SEO changes on my site, I go on ignoring this.\n\nDecember rolls around and this site is doing very well. Scrolling through the revenue on Boxing Day and I see an extra £500 in CPC, on just the 23-24th December. I'm over the moon in my naivety - thinking what I'll buy with the extra cash.\n\nOn January 1st '24, I receive notice from Google that my Ads have been limited due to Invalid Traffic. First time I've ever heard of this - lots of reading involved. Unfortunately, this limitation affected a few of my websites which was frustrating. The site is behind a CloudFlare proxy and none of the logs showed any unusual activity on the days in question.\n\nOn January 2nd, I reported the suspicious click activity to Google in the hope that my restriction would be lifted sooner. It wasn't.\n\nIt's the 5th of February today and this website has made a total of £6.13 in the last month. The good news is that £1.43 of this revenue is today and my RPM shows a glimpse of recovering.\n\nWhat I've taken from this experience is\n\n* that my site was click-bombed - either by my competition, or someone who just doesn't like my site (it's not political, just purely info).\n* that the adpocalypse appears to be lifting, some 34 days after the initial notice.\n* that I haven't found a way to prevent this sort of attack from happening again in the future - though I do now know to look for it and stop serving ads ASAP in future.",
