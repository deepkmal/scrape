    "selftext": "Hi! I work for the accounting team of a small service-based business, and we've been thinking of upgrading from spreadsheets. We’ve got around 5 full-time employees and a few contractors. Right now, we're looking for an accounting software that's ideal for our setup/business. Here's couple of features on our checklist:\n\n* Track income and expenses across multiple accounts\n* Categorize transactions automatically (plus points if it connects to our bank)\n* Handle or integrate with payroll\n* Generate useful reports like cash flow summaries, profit/loss, etc.\n* Manage recurring expenses\n* Store receipts and let me snap/upload them easily\n* Collaborate securely with our external accountant\n\nCloud-based would be ideal since most of us aren't always working from the office. If anyone here has software recommendations/suggestions that cover most of this, especially ones that work well for small businesses without massive budgets, please do let me know. Thanks so much in advance!\n\n**Edit:** As some of you suggested, I decided to go with [QuickBooks](https://reddit-out.com/qb-online). It checked off most of the features we needed, especially for tracking income/expenses, generating reports, and collaborating with our accountant. Appreciate everyone who shared their input, btw!",

QuickBooks is branding it as an AI accounting assistant. It claims to help with everything from categorizing transactions to answering finance questions inside QuickBooks. For those of you who tested it, does it actually work well with client accounts? I want to know if it also reduces the time spent on repetitive tasks or if you just ended up reviewing everything anyway. Curious as well if you’ve run into compliance or accuracy concerns when letting AI handle categorization or reporting. From an accountant’s perspective, is this tool helpful or just another feature that sounds better in theory than practice?",

Once you get past the homepage of a software, there are settings, forms, and decisions I didn’t realize I’d have to make right away. When people mention the easiest payroll to use for beginners, I’m curious what they’re reacting to. The setup flow? The way taxes are handled in the background? Or just not feeling lost after logging in?\n\nHow did you navigate your first payroll setup?",

Is this manageable for one person handling it alongside other accounting tasks?\n\nI’d really appreciate hearing what others in similar roles are using and what you wish you knew before choosing a payroll system.\n\n**Update**: After digging into the options and reading through all the comments here, I ended up going with [QuickBooks](https://outreddit.click/quickbooks-payroll) for payroll.
