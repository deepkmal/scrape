    "selftext": "Anyone else feeling like we're trapped in some weird content creation nightmare?\n\nI've been trying to build authentic content this year and everything feels fake. Someone commented about the Dead Internet Theory on one of my posts and it all made sense.\n\nBasically it's the idea that most internet content since 2016 is just bots talking to bots. AWS says 57% of content is AI generated now, heading toward 90% next year.\n\nTo compete with AI content floods, everyone says use more AI tools. Research topics with AI, generate outlines with AI, write drafts with AI, optimize for SEO with AI, create social variants with AI, schedule with AI.\n\nNow everyone's content sounds exactly the same. LinkedIn posts all start with \"Let's delve into\" and Facebook is full of Shrimp Jesus images getting bot comments.\n\nI'm stuck between being authentic (slow, expensive) or efficient (fast, sounds like everyone else). People are getting tired of AI content and going back to podcasts and interviews because they want actual humans.\n\nThe whole thing is broken. AI trains on human content, humans use AI to create content, AI content floods the web, new AI trains on AI content, everything gets worse.\n\nAre we headed toward separate human and AI internets? How do you compete without becoming part of the problem?\n\nReally tired of this constant race.\n\ndrinking game idea: take a shot every time i say AI",

    "selftext": "I'm sure this has been brought up in this sub a 1000 times already, but I wanted to get some fresh perspectives since the social media landscape shifts so fast and I have a specific situation I'm dealing with. I’m looking for the best place to buy Instagram followers to help get things moving.\n\nRight now, I’m managing a few different brand pages, mostly focused on lifestyle and photography, and some of them are getting pretty big. Most of the growth has been organic so far, and I’ve been using standard engagement strategies to keep things steady. However, as the accounts grow and the competition gets tougher, it's becoming way more difficult to maintain that momentum or get over certain plateaus.\n\nMy main question is this: what site would you actually suggest for established accounts?\n\nThe ideal scenario would be a platform that provides high quality accounts that won't just unfollow after a week. I need something reliable that offers a slow delivery over time so it looks natural and doesn't flag my account.\n\nBudget wise, I'm flexible, but I don't want to throw money away. Spending 20$ or so a month is totally fine, but I’m definitely hesitant about buying Instagram followers from a site that charges a massive upfront fee without any way to test the quality first.\n\nWould love to hear what's working for you guys lately!",

    "title": "Reddit marketing is underrated",
    "selftext": "I’ve been building subreddits for businesses for the past 3 years, and I’m honestly surprised there isn’t more competition. It all started with me losing my Facebook ads account when I was dropshipping 10 years ago, and it turned into one of the most valuable marketing skills I’ve ever picked up.\n\nIn this post, I’m going to break down how you can use Reddit to drive sales organically. I’ll go deeper than I did in my other post, where I explained how [I pushed $2.5 million in a year for a pet accessories brand without any paid ads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShopifyPros/comments/1n2obb9/25_million_in_sales_while_paid_ads_are_turned_off/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n**You are not in control unless you control a subreddit in your niche.** But building trust and gaining traction means posting, commenting, messaging, and actually showing up. With that said, let’s hop into the actionable parts.\n\n**Step 1: Build the subreddit**  \nThis is the easy part.\n\nYou’re not creating a subreddit for your brand. You’re creating one for your niche.\n\nIf you sell coffee gear, build a space about better brewing at home. If you sell skincare products, build a community where people talk about skincare tips. If you sell exercise equipment, make a sub for people who work out at home or build a group around calisthenics.\n\nUse a similar header and sub picture as the largest subreddit in your niche. Use similar rules to the biggest sub too. Don’t reinvent what already works.\n\nHave 15 niche-relevant posts ready and use an app like Postpone to schedule them. Do not even think about mentioning your brand until you hit 3k members. You’re playing the long game.\n\nThe goal is to build a funnel that doesn’t look like a funnel. The best marketing doesn’t feel like marketing.\n\n**Step 2: Grow the subreddit**  \nThis is probably the hardest part, but it’s also where things start to move.\n\nConsistency is everything.\n\nThere are tools that let you automate DMs based on keywords. Here's how I use them: any time someone mentions your niche, they get a message like “Hey, saw your post about \\[niche\\]. I love \\[niche\\] too and just started a subreddit you might like.”\n\nAt the end, include something personal like “We're looking for another mod if you’re interested” or “It’s my first time building a subreddit, any tips or feedback would be appreciated.”\n\nThe message should feel real enough that they question whether it was automated.\n\nNow onto content. After your first 15 posts, you want to post 4 to 6 times a week. Most of it should be UGC. But content varies by niche.\n\nIf you sell arts and crafts supplies, you need a shitload of DIY content. If you sell pet accessories, you better start bugging your friends to let you take photos of their pets. The more you live in the niche, the better your content will be.\n\nOnce your sub passes 8k engaged members, mix in these types of posts:\n\n* Customer stories and use cases \n* Before and after setups \n* Polls and community questions \n* Quick wins or tips related to your niche \n* How we built this breakdowns AMA threads with founders, customers, or influencers UGC reposts (with permission) \n* Product comparisons with no bias\n\nThese posts help your sub show up more in Reddit’s algorithm. Use them to start real discussions and signal value.\n\n**Step 3: Monetize the subreddit**  \nThis part is easy if you don’t screw it up.\n\nPeople don’t give a flying f\\*ck about your brand. They joined because they care about the niche. Try to monetize too fast or too obviously, and they’ll bounce.\n\nBut at this point, you can start using the perks of owning your own sub. Pin the posts you want people to see. Suppress your competitors. Hold the attention without directly selling anything.\n\nDon’t sell on Reddit. Move people off-platform. Build a landing page that gives them something free in exchange for their email. It doesn’t have to cost you anything. Could be access to a private group, a niche-relevant guide, or even a downloadable checklist.\n\nIt just has to be good enough that people want to opt in.\n\nOnce they do, it’s game on. Your email list should be doing 40 percent of your total sales. It’s retargeting fuel, it’s a long-term asset, and it’s your insurance against platforms nuking your reach.\n\nThe real value here is supercharging your list.\n\nAnd on top of that, the subreddit itself becomes a goldmine of social proof, content, feedback, and trust that money can’t buy.\n\nHere’s how to slowly start introducing your products:\n\n* Use your product in examples or breakdowns \n* Post UGC that clearly shows your product in use \n* Offer early access or exclusive member-only deals \n* Run giveaways that require comments or submissions \n* Answer product-related questions in detail, with visuals if possible\n\nThis isn’t for brands doing under 10k a month. But Reddit still helped me make my first few sales back when I was selling random shit online at 16.\n\nIt doesn’t hurt if you’re smaller, but this is really for people who want to take over their niche. I’ve seen the best results using this with 7-figure brands scaling into 8. They already have momentum. This gives them an edge their bigger competitors can’t touch.\n\nMost big brands aren’t willing to engage with the community. They’re not going to do the dirty work. Which is exactly why this works.",

I might even pair it with bought views so the ratio looks more natural. The problem is I have no idea which sites are actually legit or safe to use.\n\nFor anyone who has done this before, did buying likes actually help your engagement or ranking at all? Did it look natural and did they stick over time? Also curious if there are any services that deliver real looking likes instead of random low quality ones.\n\nWould love to hear any honest recommendations or good and bad experiences.

    "selftext": "Like most content teams, we went all in on AI content about a year ago. \n\n\"10x your output!\" \"Scale without hiring!\" You know the pitch.\n\nAfter 6 months of tracking everything, I finally sat down to see what actually performed.\n\n Sharing because I think a lot of teams are flying blind on this.\n\n**The setup:**\n\nWe tagged all our content by creation method:\n\n* **Pure AI:** Generated with ChatGPT/Claude, light editing for accuracy, published\n* **AI-assisted:** AI for research/outline/first draft, heavy human editing and rewriting\n* **Human-written:** Outlined and written by humans, AI only for grammar/polish\n\nTracked traffic, time on page, conversions, and rankings over 6 months. \\~45 pieces total across the three categories.\n\n**The speed difference (where AI wins):**\n\nNo surprise here, AI content is way faster to produce.\n\n* Pure AI pieces: \\~45 min from idea to publish\n* AI-assisted: \\~2.5 hours\n* Human-written: \\~6-8 hours\n\nWe were pumping out 3-4x more content with AI. Felt productive as hell.\n\n**The traffic difference:**\n\nThis is where the data humbled us.\n\nOver 6 months:\n\n* Human-written content averaged **5.4x more organic traffic** than pure AI content\n* Human content showed **steady traffic growth** month over month\n* Pure AI content **flatlined or declined** after initial indexing\n* AI-assisted (hybrid) content landed in the middle, about 2.8x the traffic of pure AI\n\nThe pattern was consistent. Pure AI pieces would get indexed, get some initial traffic, then just... plateau. Human pieces kept climbing.\n\n**Why we think this happened:**\n\n1. **Depth:** Our AI pieces answered the question but didn't go deeper. Human writers added angles, examples, and insights that kept people reading (and linking).\n2. **Voice:** The AI content was *fine* but generic. It sounded like everyone else's AI content. Human pieces had actual perspective.\n3. **Originality:** AI can only remix what exists. Our best-performing pieces had original data, unique frameworks, or contrarian takes that AI couldn't generate.\n4. **Updates:** Human writers naturally updated and improved pieces. AI content sat there unchanged.\n\n**The conversion difference:**\n\nHere's where it gets really interesting for anyone focused on leads, not just traffic:\n\n* Human-written: 3.2% conversion rate (email signup or demo request)\n* AI-assisted: 2.1% conversion rate\n* Pure AI: 0.8% conversion rate\n\nThe gap is even bigger than the traffic gap. People apparently don't convert from generic content. Who knew.\n\n**What we actually do now:**\n\nWe didn't abandon AI, that would be stupid. But we completely changed how we use it.\n\n**AI now handles:**\n\n* Research and data gathering (huge time saver)\n* First draft outlines\n* Repurposing existing content into different formats\n* Technical SEO stuff (meta descriptions, schema, etc.)\n* Drafts for \"commodity\" content (basic how-tos, glossary pages)\n\n**Humans now own:**\n\n* Anything meant to rank for competitive keywords\n* Thought leadership and POV pieces\n* Content meant to convert (bottom of funnel)\n* Anything where voice/brand matters\n* Final editing on everything\n\n**The ratio that's working for us:** About 70% of our *volume* uses AI somewhere in the process, but humans touch 100% of content before it goes live. Even if it's just a 15-minute edit pass.\n\nAI made us faster at creating content nobody wanted to read.\n\nThe unlock wasn't using *more* AI or *less* AI, it was figuring out which parts of the process benefit from AI speed vs. which parts need human depth.\n\nSo if you're just publishing more pure AI content and wondering why traffic isn't growing, this might be why.\n\nWhat's your AI content workflow? \n\nPure AI, hybrid, or still mostly human? Curious what others are seeing.",

    "selftext": "I’ve been meaning to make this post for a while because a lot of my agency success has actually come from Reddit. I personally started to see the most success in my life when I realized there was no point in trying to gatekeep information. So I guess you could say this post is me doubling down on that.\n\nI think this post will be useful to agency owners at all sizes. I’ll walk you through how I got my first few clients, how I scaled to my first 30k month, and I’ll touch on a couple of life lessons I picked up along the way. So let’s get into my agency story time.\n\n**Quick Backstory**  \nMy agency journey started in 2020, but my ecom journey probably started in middle school about 15 years ago. My first business started off with $100 I got for Christmas and me just recognizing the demand for cheap clothing and knock-offs. From ages 12 to 16 I sold everything that was trending. If you’re my around age, think silly bandz, G-Shocks, crewnecks, snapbacks, OBEY etc.\n\nBy 16, I expanded past selling locally. I dabbled in affiliate marketing, eBay dropshipping, and eventually got into Shopify. 20+ underwhelming brands later, I finished high school and started my Digital Business Marketing degree in college. Between tuition and getting wrecked in the crypto market, the 40k I had saved vanished in less than 18 months.\n\nThat’s when the agency was born. I got a minimum wage job at a grocery store and met my current business partner. We were both entrepreneurial hustler types. He had a friend who ran a successful agency and gave us free access to his course. We learned a lot from him because he was already a top 2% earner at 18. The agency path just made sense. I had ecom experience, and my FB account had just gotten banned for copyright on the brand I was running.\n\n**How I got my first 3 clients**  \nThe story behind my first 3 clients is kinda silly. I had a mentor tell me recently, “you need to go back to being r\\*tarded,” because my blind optimism and quirky personality were my competitive advantage.\n\nMy first client DMed me saying “whatsup.” Let’s call him Jeff. At the time, I had post notifications on for Shopify’s Twitter account and would reply to every tweet just saying dumb shit. The reply that got Jeff to DM me was a pic of my friend’s puppy with the caption: “My friend says you should get your email marketing setup ASAP.” Jeff was 16, from my area, and doing 80k/month selling giant plushie d\\*cks. He thought my post was funny and hit me up. We talked for a few days, and boom. First client. To this day, he’s still one of the most valuable people in my network. Sends me referrals all the time. His network blows my mind. Major lesson here, *he just messages anyone who seems cool and is into ecommerce.*\n\nClient 2 came from cold DM. COVID had just hit, and our whole pitch was aimed at brick-and-mortar stores that were forced to close temporarily. We’d ask: “Are you selling online? What are you doing with your emails?” and pitch something like: “Let us run your emails free for 30 days. If you like it, keep going. Only pay a commission on the extra money we bring in.”\n\nClient 3 was a dropshipper who started seeing my tweets because Jeff followed me and would reply tomy tweets all the time. By the time my partner DMed him, he was already a warm lead. Closed easily. He said, “I’ve been seeing you guys online for a while.” Remember that quote. It became a recurring theme once we started scaling.\n\n**First 30k Month**  \nWe hit 30k/month in our first year. Started Q1, and by Q4 we had a solid roster and some decent employees. First half of the year was cold DMs and referrals. Second half, we landed a couple more big clients through referrals. Rev share plus the Q4 boost made it feel like we were printing money.\n\n**Starting back from zero**  \nThis was a huge learning experience. I didn’t realize how inflated Q4 sales really are. At that point, all our clients were young dropshippers, and they started dropping like flies in Q1. Ad bans, payment processor issues, low product demand. The entire roster fizzled out. We thought we were about to hit 50k/month. In reality, we were further from it than ever.\n\nI had to rebuild from Reddit and Facebook. Started posting value posts every week. At first, it was general stuff, but I quickly realized no one cares unless you give up real info. I became an open book. Some posts were so detailed that other agency owners would DM me saying I was “ruining the market.” But I didn’t care. If I could genuinely help people, I knew I’d start building trust and a name for myself.\n\nSales calls got simple. People would say things like:\n\n* “I’ve been sending your posts to my marketing team and they still won’t do it.”\n* “I’ve been seeing your posts for months.”\n* “I already know you know what you’re doing. What’s the price? Send the invoice.”\n\nThat shift got us away from dropshippers and into more legit brands.\n\nWe got back to 30k/month. Then had our worst year ever trying to hit 50k/month.\n\n**Worst year ever**  \n*This was the year everything looked like it was clicking. But we got humbled fast.*\n\nOur “best” employee started stealing time. He billed us for freelance work that he did on the side. We caught him with a time tracking software. Fired him. He instantly DMed all our clients and actually landed one by offering a dirt-cheap rate. He’d already been managing the account for months, so it was an easy switch for them.\n\nThen we lost our biggest long-term client. He got angel investor for a new production facility and the investor brought his own team. One of their rules to get the investment was to use their in-house marketers. That client was almost a third of our revenue. We’d scaled him from 80k/month to almost 300k/month. That one hurt. Lesson learned. No client is guaranteed. Sometimes good work gets you fired.\n\nSame month, we lost a few more clients for dumb reasons. One guy dropped us because we took a call with his biggest competitor. We had no idea how small the niche was. He saw it as a conflict of interest. Looking back, I get it. But still an L.\n\nOur outreach system fell apart. Mods banned me from the best subs. We tried cold email. First guy we hired had a “guarantee.” Never booked a single call. We got a refund, but wasted six months. Hired another guy. Still nothing. Wasted thousands.\n\nPersonal shit started piling on too. Felt like a movie. Partner diagnosed with cancer. Ex faked a pregnancy. Grandparents passed. That stretch was brutal and probably affected the quality of our work too.\n\n**Scaling to 50k/month**  \nThis is where I’m at now. After the bad year, I went back to what worked. Posting and building connections. Filming content even though I hate being on camera. Running ads to boost reach. Doing cold email myself. Getting some traction again.\n\nSome of our the biggest wins have come from the people I’ve met on Reddit. Some white-label our services. Some send us leads. Some Redditors are literally just good friends that I met online. \n\n**Biggest takeaways**\n\n* Focus on building relationships in the right places instead of chasing quick cash\n* Don’t gatekeep. Generic value posts suck. Show you actually know what you’re doing\n* Lead magnets beat cold outreach. Better sales positioning\n* Be picky with clients. Cheap ones are usually the biggest headaches\n* Never rely on one client. Even if you’re crushing it, you can still get dropped\n\n**Conclusion**  \nThis post got longer than I expected.

No point spending thousands if they won’t stand behind results.\n\n\n\nMake sure they get modern search, not just google tricks.\n\n\n\nCheck case studies, especially in your industry (saas, ecommerce, whatever you’re in).\n\n\n\nWatch the reporting.

It should be used complementary to social media. Most successful artists use social media to post content, build their following, and even create a sense of community. However, it is a well-known fact that not every follower will see your posts. For this reason, it might go unnoticed by some of your closest fans when you post a hugely important announcement.

But this is a nice distinction to have since your email list will then only consists of fans that are actually engaged with you. For this reason, email is a great medium to use for musicians to keep in touch with their close fans, make important announcements, and let them know about any new music, products, services, tour dates, or anything else you've got going on. \n\n**But now, how can you grow your email list as a musician?**\n\n1. Give out early access\n\n2. Give something away for free\n\n3. Use a pop-up on your website\n\n4. Do a giveaway\n\n5. Host a contest\n\n6. Collaborate with other musicians\n\n7.

    "selftext": "Ive been fixated on short form content for close to two years. Genuinely unhealthy fixated. 12 hour days testing everything, watching every \"go viral\" guide, buying courses, still nothing worked. Content would die at 300-500 views no matter what I tried. Started thinking I just didn't have what it takes.\n\nThen I stopped guessing and started actually measuring what was happening frame by frame in my content. I went through roughly 50 of them, documenting every single dropout point, noting exactly when people would exit and trying to figure out why. Thats when I identified 9 patterns that kept killing my reach:\n\n1. Rewatch rate matters way more than total views. The algorithm pushes content people watch multiple times way harder than content they watch once. I started burying quick text flashes, using faster transitions, adding small details you only catch the second time. Rewatch rate jumped from 8% to 31% and thats when views truly exploded.\n2. Vague hooks get ignored immediately. \"Wait for it\" or \"you wont believe this\" gets scrolled past. But \"100 squats daily made my knees click weird\" stops people. Be exact, not unclear.\n3. Extended captions are secretly powerful. Everyone says \"hook in first 3 seconds\" but nobody mentions captions. Write 3-4 sentences minimum that are keyword packed and actually make people pause to read. While they're reading, they're watching your content loop. Retention increases, algorithm pushes harder. Its essentially bonus watch time.\n4. Gaps longer than 1 second destroy momentum. Tracked this obsessively, anything over 1.2 seconds and people think the content ended. What feels like dramatic pacing to you feels like nothing happening to someone scrolling. Cut everything tighter than what seems natural.\n5. Second 5 is where you truly lose them. Most people bail between seconds 4-7 if you havent shown them a reason to continue. I was building suspense which was idiotic. Now I present my best stat or visual right at second 5. Thats your actual hook.\n6. Lighting kills you before the hook does. Overexposed or underexposed content gets suppressed hard. The algorithm recognizes when your lighting is terrible and it crushes your distribution before people even see your hook. I began filming near windows during golden hour or using an inexpensive ring light. Instant impact in how far content got pushed.\n7. Upload timing matters significantly more than people realize. I tested posting the same content at different times for two weeks. 9am got 400 views, 7pm got 12k views. Your audience has peak activity windows and the algorithm rewards early engagement velocity. Find your optimal time and stick to it consistently.\n8. Visual change matters more than you'd think. If your content appears the same for more than 3 seconds, people's brains disconnect. Started switching angles, inserting b roll, moving text around constantly. Went from losing 50% of people midway to retaining 70%.\n9. Audio quality tanks credibility immediately (DEPENDS ON NICHE). Bad audio makes your content appear amateur even if everything else is solid. People will tolerate average visuals but they exit on muffled or echo-heavy audio. I got a $20 lavalier mic and my completion rates jumped 15%. The algorithm picks up when people watch longer.\n\nReal talk, these tactics only worked because I could actually identify what was breaking in my content. Second by second exits, exact moments people left, why retention was dropping.\n\nI have also used tools that have been very helpful in this growth. I was using the GoViral app for a while but honestly it was all hype, their recommendations actually reduced my reach. Tried Creafyco as well, same letdown.\n\nThe best tool I have ever used is [TikAlyzer](http://tikalyzer.com). It analyzes your video and tells you what's wrong with it and how to fix it for it to get more views. Its like having a professional content creator help you improve your videos.\n\nStandard analytics just tell you people are leaving. TikAlyzer shows the exact moment, the actual reason, and what to modify next video.\n\nIf youre stuck posting regularly but cant exceed 1k views, its not your content. You just cant see whats actually destroying your retention.\n\nUnderstanding this stuff genuinely felt impossible for the longest time. I wish someone had just broken this down for me two years ago instead of me struggling for so long. So thats what Im doing here.",

    "selftext": "So here’s the thing: AI-generated content isn’t bad, especially with the latest LLMs. It’s actually scary competent at cranking out intros, summaries, even halfway decent blog posts. But the more I use it, the more I notice this eerie sameness. \n\nThe goal of content marketing is to inform users/customers beyond what other marketing channels can manage. And that means mastery of language is very essential to the success of any content marketing efforts\n\nA case can be made that gen AI should be good at this if you can give it a detailed enough information about the product/service. And for most part I have personally gotten good results. I have to do some editing but the general results are usually okay.\n\nA mix of clever prompting, structured information on the product/service, maybe some fine tuned LLMs and sometimes use of AI text humanizing tools like Phrasly AI or free tools like UnAIMyText should theoretically give good and replicable results up to the point of \"replacing content marketers\" or  \"one person doing the job of 50 people\"\n\nBut I don't think that's possible, not if you want quality work anyway. What I've seen work in content marketing is the ability to empathize with a user, make connections between disparate elements of the industry and a ton of small other stuff that is just impossible to code into an AI system. That's why I believe that any content marketer worth their salt shouldn't be a bit scared of AI taking their jobs.",

    "selftext": " While I was researching, I found out that people tend to go with the platform that has already proven to be successful for other businesses. Hence, Patreon is the biggest platform for selling content today. But many creators create a profile without thinking about the long-term effects:\n\nThere are a lot of content creators out there who use Patreon solely because a lot of other well-known content creators in their industry are using these platforms. You see them making big bucks on these platforms, so you figure this could work for you too. And you’re right, it could. But if you are planning to generate a big chunk of your income on these platforms, you must consider the commission rates charged on everything you earn.\n\nPatreon, for instance, offers various plans to creators who are serious about earning a steady income on their platform. Their commissions for those creators range from 8-12%. Besides that, they are also charging you transaction costs up to $0.30. For a $1 transaction from one of your fans, that’s a staggering 30% of your hard-earned income.\n\n**Your content has value, and your fans are paying you for it.**\n\nSo, take control of your income and make sure you can keep most of that. Especially if you are looking to grow that revenue. Your income matters. Therefore, when deciding what platform you will use for selling your content, consider the commissions. Especially because the more you grow, the more you will hand over to these companies. There are great alternatives! For example, [Fangage](https://www.fangage.com/) is similar to Patreon but doesn't have these ridiculously high commissions.\n\nMoreover, if you'd like, [you can read more about this alternative here](https://www.fangage.com/blog/tired-of-costly-commissions-to-patreon-or-onlyfans-use-this-alternative-instead). Your income from selling content or subscriptions should be yours to keep.",

This guide shows a simple system to grow fast, stay sane, and turn views into real chats and clients.   \n  \n**key takeaways:**  \n**-** Your profile is a landing page that sells value, not job titles.  \n\\- Relevance beats volume. Connect with people who care about your topic.  \n\\- Comments are mini posts. Thoughtful replies drive follows and leads.  \n\\- Simple content pillars plus reuse will beat chasing trends.  \n\\- The first 60 minutes after posting matter a lot for reach.  \n\\- Collaboration is the real algorithm. Share audiences to grow faster.  \n\\- Use gentle automation to scale, but keep messages human.  \n\\- Track signals. 3+ engagements from someone is a cue to start a chat.\n\n\n\n* **How to Become a Better Copywriter: Advice I Wish I Had** \\- *Copyblogger*\n\n&gt;Most people think good copywriting is about sounding clever. It’s not. The real challenge is writing words that get results-copy that makes readers feel understood, trust you, and take action.   \n  \n**key takeaways:**  \n\\- Copywriting is about clarity and conversion, not fancy words.  \n\\- Deeply understand your customer’s pain points and objections.   \n\\- Study competitors and keep a swipe file of great examples.   \n\\- Build a simple writing process to avoid writer’s block.   \n\\- Practice daily and test your own ideas on real products.   \n\\- Use AI smartly for research and phrasing, not full writing.   \n\\- Master one platform before trying to write for all.   \n\\- Measure ROI based on real conversions, not engagement.   \n\\- Join a feedback community to learn faster.   \n\\- Act fast, but be patient for results to show.\n\n\n\n* **Marketing ;;;;;;;;\\[\\[\\[\\[\\[\\[\\[inspiration....ksdjflaksdjf** \\- *Marketing Ideas*\n\n&gt;Most brands try too hard to be perfect, polished, and serious online - and that makes people scroll past.

    "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\n\n\nBrief Background: After 21 years of working in tech MNCs and startups, I finally hung up my boots last year. Since then, I’ve been consulting for startups and building products.\n\n\n\n1st Realization: Building products and growing startups all come \\*after\\* marketing. Marketing is the lifeblood, without it, none of the other parts work.\n\n\n\n2nd Realization: Paid ads are a great way to start, but unless you can figure out how to keep your CAC low, they don’t work long term. Moreover, you’re always at the mercy of ad platforms — one tweak in the algorithm can send you back to page one.\n\n\n\n3rd Realization: I don’t even like saying this, given how often it’s been said before, but yes I realized that content is the only way to make long-term marketing work.\n\n\n\n4th Realization: After creating random content and seeing dozens of startups do the same, I realized that creating content without a \"content strategy\" is like building a house without a plan.\n\n\n\n5th Realization: This subject is so deep that watching random YouTube videos, reading blog posts, or chatting with ChatGPT alone isn’t enough.\n\n\n\nHence, I’m looking for some like-minded folks to talk about content strategy - to swap learnings about what works (and what doesn’t) and to generally explore this space together.\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested, please DM me. Let’s see where the adventure takes us!\n\n",

The breakthrough for me was repurposing instead of just creating new. \n\nA 2000-word blog doesn’t have to die after publishing, it can become 5 LinkedIn posts, 3 shorts, an email, and even a webinar topic. I tested this with a SaaS client and the same blog ended up driving traffic across three different platforms for weeks. Volume matters less than consistency and distribution. By slicing one piece of content into formats people actually consume, you get way more mileage out of your work.

The idea is that, as a marketer, you need to build a strategy that covers all the key platforms where your content might be discussed or discovered.

Here’s what I mean:\n\n* A regularly updated blog on your official website\n* Active social media (brand account + engaged community)\n* Managed business listings across platforms\n* Listings and reviews on comparison and rating sites\n* Mentions from influencers and thought leaders\n\nSo if your brand has a well-rounded presence and stays active on user-generated platforms, AI is more likely to trust and reference your content in its responses. I was skeptical of this idea at first, but after seeing the SE Ranking and Planable integration, I’m starting to believe that cross-platform strategy might be the most effective way forward in modern marketing. \n\nI mean, If they are thinking SEO + SMM will work fine, maybe this is the way?",

If so, what are the pros and cons you've found?\n\nWhat are the biggest hurdles you face when trying to adapt long-form content for social platforms?\n\nWhat would be a \"must-have\" feature for an AI tool like this to be truly useful for you?\n\nWe’re trying to build something that genuinely helps, and honest feedback from this community is invaluable.

You don’t wanna talk about your offers because you don’t think they’re good enough.\n\nBut the people who are making 4-5 figures every month are the ones who aren’t afraid to put themselves out there, the ones who are bold, the ones who say what they mean and stand on that, 10 toes down. If you are not that kind of person, you’re never gonna get your business to the point where you are scaling.\n\nCause I want you to think about it for a second: the last time you said you didn’t wanna release X product because it wasn’t perfect, yet you ended up not talking about it, right? Whereas if you would have released that product, talked about it in your content, marketed it for your online business, even if you messed up, you didn’t get any sales, you didn’t get any inquires about it, guess what? At least you know what to do differently.\n\nBiggest part about running an online business, especially if you want to scale to four or five figures every single month on repeat, is the fact that you have to learn what works and what doesn’t work. Emphasis on what doesn’t work. When you’re not afraid to make those mistakes, especially early on in your online business, when you make those mistakes, you can study how to avoid making the same mistakes again and get better at your business.\n\nSo here’s what you’re gonna do: release that product, post that piece of content, talk about your idea. Whatever you are holding back in your online business, guess what? It is also holding your online business back. It may be messy, it may be ugly, it may be sloppy, but any step that you can take forward towards your dream online business is still a step forward at the end of the day.",

They'd claim they made millions from their \"business,\" but when you really looked at it, their actual money was coming from selling you the course about that business, not the business itself. The thing that attracted you in the first place wasn't actually their main source of income.\n\nI actually tried following their advice.

They're just repeating whatever hook format is working to go viral and get more followers. \n\nPeople don't seem to care about honesty anymore - they'll say whatever it takes to go viral. They'll take any trending format, exaggerate the hell out of it, and claim it as their own experience even when it's complete bullcrap.\n\nIt's refreshing to see the general public waking up to these tactics. There's so much dishonesty in this space, and it's about time people started calling it out. \n\nAnyone else noticed this trend?

    "title": "Seeing success doing the opposite of everyone else",
    "selftext": "I've done marketing for e-commerce brands for about a decade. Just about everyone I know who started an agency around the same time as me has either switched industries or is going all in on \"AI business solutions.\"\n\n*Call me crazy*, but I looked into a vast amount of \"revolutionary\" AI tools for e-commerce brands, and I found them all underwhelming. There are some good tools to manage analytics, help with copywriting, and automate simple tasks, but nothing that does anything the average business owner can't do on their own.\n\nThe big issue I found with businesses chasing AI to become more \"efficient\" is that it makes the brand less personal. I've specialized in email marketing for the past 5 years, and making things less personal is the exact opposite of the goal I've been trying to achieve. I think the disconnect here for me is my intentions with ai. I want to use it to enhance the customer experience, but a lot of people just want to use it to save time and money.\n\nThis post is going to break down how I've done the opposite of where the market seems to be trending over the past few years and how it worked.\n\n**Customer Service**\n\nHave you ever had a serious issue with a company and had trouble reaching a real person?\n\nIt sucks. I remember yelling into my phone, saying \"CUSTOMER SERVICE\" months ago, when all I could get access to was an AI voice handling PayPal support on the phone.\n\nI've always looked at AI as a way to make things better, but sometimes you just need to talk to a real person. Making that more difficult only ruins the buying experience.\n\nEveryone I know is making a hard push for AI receptionists, chatbots, and automated messages. I've been hiring laid-off customer service agents who speak English as their first language and deploying them on social media, private groups, and email for the brands I work with.\n\nBeing able to DM a brand with your order number and solve a complex issue within 5 minutes is almost unheard of. But it's relatively easy to pull off. Simple things like this put your brand on another level.\n\nYou would not believe the number of customers who thank the brands we work with for being easy to reach, transparent, and human.\n\n**Groups**\n\nAI can replace your graphic designer, your email copywriter, and eventually your media buyer. There are probably already AI softwares that can duplicate your website, your ads, and your email sequences in minutes.\n\nBut it will never be able to replicate a group of people who are genuinely interested in what you're selling.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I made a post called \"Reddit Marketing is Underrated.\" I talked about how I build subreddits for brands. It's a goldmine for interacting with customers, doing market research, and boosting organic sales.\n\nI never realized how powerful a group of 20k engaged users in your sub or group could be. The possibilities are endless. You can collect emails, build funnels, and use data for retargeting.\n\nWhether it's Reddit, Facebook, or Discord, the group-building works. It's endless free UGC. It grows organically once you get momentum. It builds trust. And if you stick to it, it becomes your cheapest client acquisition channel.\n\nIf you treat people well in your group, they will take it upon themselves to shill your brand and want nothing in return.\n\nI made an entire post about how I pushed 2.5 million for a brand that stopped running ads in less than a year. The money was made because we made people enthusiastic about supporting the brand.\n\n**Personalized Emails and SMS**\n\nEveryone does some version of email marketing (I'd hope so), but few take it seriously. There's a lot more to list segmentation than just sending emails to your 90-day engaged list. There's a lot more to merge tag personalization than just using it for first names.\n\nI'll give you an example here. Ask yourself: \"How would I send out a free shipping campaign?\"\n\nYou'd probably just create one version of a free shipping email and send it to your engaged list. It would work. You'd get some sales. But it could have done twice as well.\n\nHere's what I'd do (for a brand that has at least 20k emails): I'd make 3 versions of this email. They will all be basically the same, but the copywriting will be slightly different.\n\nThe 3 segments I'd send to are:  \n1x Buyers  \n2x+ Buyers (VIPs)  \nNon-buyers\n\nWe tell the 1x buyers that this is our way of saying thanks for their last order.  \nWe tell the VIPs that this is an exclusive sale just for them (and maybe even sweeten the deal).  \nWe tell non-buyers that now is the best time to try our products and avoid shipping fees.\n\nNow for subject lines. Most will say something like:\n\n**Subject line:** Free Shipping for a Limited Time ✈️\n\nNext time, try something like this for nearly double the open rate:\n\n**Subject line:** We're doing free shipping for customers in {Users\\_City}\n\nThis is just one example of how you can go the extra mile with email marketing, add personalization, and make people feel special.\n\n**Flipping the Script**\n\nYou'd be surprised how many stores rely on ads to keep the brand alive. Some brands we see have 80%+ of their sales coming from ads and only 20% from email and organic.  It's not uncommon for me to see 60%+ of the sales coming from a Klaviyo account because of what I build on the backend.\n\nWe flipped the script. We focused on the customer experience and organic growth.\n\nThe goal is to get to a point where 80% of the sales come from sales channels that the brand owns, like social media, email, and groups.\n\nThen we put a massive focus on building the things money can't buy. You can't buy organic sales. You can't use AI to generate an engaged email list or an active group with potential customers in your niche.\n\nI truly believe that focusing on the customer experience and owning your organic sales channels is going to be the only thing store owners can do to stand out in the coming years.\n\nEverything else is just too easy to duplicate or could be taken away with an account ban.",
