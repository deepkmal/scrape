    "title": "Youtube’s entire creator economy is about to collapse (ai replacement fact not theory)",
    "selftext": "I worked for a few years inside one of the large teams at Google that touched Youtube’s product monetization roadmap. I’m not going to drop names or specific tools because I don’t want this tied back to me, but here’s what’s actually coming and it’s going to blindside a lot of people.\n\nLet’s start with something most creators don’t fully get: the CEO of a public company doesn’t work for you.\n\nThey work for shareholders. Their entire legal responsibility is to maximize shareholder value. If they don’t they can literally get replaced or even sued for breach of fiduciary duty.\n\nSo when people talk about “Youtube caring about creators” understand this: that was never the business model.\n\nCreators were just the cheapest content engine available at the time.\n\nBut that’s changing fast.\n\nHere’s the quiet roadmap I saw forming internally (and you can connect the dots from public info too):\n\n1. AI video models are getting better exponentially. The storytelling, pacing, and visuals are already at early stage netflix level in labs. I’ve seen tests that made even internal employees do double takes.\n2. Generation speed is collapsing. Rendering a full video used to take hours. Now it’s minutes. Soon it’ll be real-time.\n3. Hardware requirements are falling through the floor. What once needed a $10k GPU rig will run on standard consumer devices.\n\nThat combo means the cost curve is about to invert.\n\nBetter → Faster → Cheaper.\n\nAt some point ai generated content becomes economically superior to human creators. And here’s where it gets uncomfortable:\n\nYoutube’s revenue share with creators is 55/45.\n\nWhen the company itself can generate host and own the full rights to ai videos… why keep paying 55% out?\n\nDo the math.\n\nEvery AI video they generate in-house is 100% margin.\n\nEvery human video costs them 55%.\n\nNow remember the CEO’s job: maximize shareholder value.\n\nSo what happens next is basically inevitable.\n\nThey’ll start integrating AI videos directly into the recommendation engine, testing performance against creator uploads. When those videos outperform (and they will) ad buyers will shift budgets there.\n\nThat gives leadership data justification to pour more resources into genai production.\n\nFrom there the transition will look slow on the outside more “ai assisted” tools, maybe “ai cocreation programs.” But it’s a replacement plan.\n\nAt scale creators become redundant.\n\nThe audience won’t even notice because the content will still feel personalized.\n\nThat’s the real pivot: Youtube doesn’t need creators to personalize content anymore. The algorithm and the models are the creators.\n\nAnd yes I’ve seen the economic models that make this worth it. When the cost of a video approaches zero, the ROI per ad-minute skyrockets. That’s what Wall Street wants. That’s what the CEO is legally obligated to deliver.\n\nIt’s not another stupid conspiracy. It’s just modern capitalism at scale.\n\nI’ve been saying this for years but people are only now starting to wake up to it:\n\nCreators were never the product.\n\nThey were the training data.\n\n(I’m not going to name any tools or labs already capable of this that’ll just get moderators to remove my post)",

    "selftext": "I hate to be alarmist, but this is just true. Traditional SEO is dying. No brand will benefit from posting blogs like '8 tips for X'. AI overviews answer that in seconds for you. Zero clicks required.\n\nSo, here's what I think is coming next: opinion-first content that leans on opinions, unique insights, real lived experiences by humans. NONE of those are going away.\n\nThink Medium-style content creation but for company websites, bylined by the individual team members themselves – the CTO, CEO, Head of Product, CS lead... you name it!\n\nSince anyone can now record a voice memo and turn messy or highly technical thoughts into actually readable content, this is what I believe we will see more of. But not even that brands will create the same volume of this content, but fewer and more curated/unique pieces each month.\n\nThoughts? Also, are any other tools offering this kind of content creation asides from ChatGPT?\n\n**POST EDIT:** For context, I own two content marketing agencies and am a marketer myself. I am specifically talking about traditional SEO / TOFU-style content. I also believe that SEO will shift into a new form of SEO in this post-AI era. So, to correct myself, I mean 'Traditional TOFU SEO is dying' lol. Hope everyone is happy now ha",

    "title": "What'll actually work in 2026 for SEO",
    "selftext": "Happy new year everyone!\n\nJust to get things straight right away: this post isn't BS.\n\nSEO is in a terrible state these days. Experts share contradictory advice, agencies try to make SEO very complex so they can charge more. And AI search makes it even more blurry as people claim GEO is completely different from SEO when in reality there's like a 80% overlap between SEO &amp; whatever you call the new \"AI SEO\".\n\nSo this is a **curated** list. What doesn't work isn't listed here.\n\nIf you do just the first 2 and wasn't doing it before, I guarantee you'll get +6-10 positions for the associated pages on Google depending on your niche.\n\nI know this works because I ran experiments on 4 different websites I own and I helped about 30 different websites implement these strategies.\n\nFor the context, my name's Vincent, I run 4 SaaS, one of which is **BlogSEO** which handles the SEO for more than 150 websites, and I'm also running an SEO agency who currently manages 3 websites.\n\nHere are the tactics I've seen working consistently across multiple websites:\n\n**1. Refresh old content (easiest win)**\n\nGo to Google Search Console. Find posts ranking positions 8-20. These are *so close* to getting traffic but invisible on page 2.\n\nUpdate them: add a new section, fix outdated stats, improve the intro. Then update the published date.\n\nI've seen posts jump 10+ positions within weeks. Lowest hanging fruit in SEO.\n\n**2. Add authors to your blog posts**\n\nGoogle's E-E-A-T framework cares about *who* wrote your content. Add a visible author with a short bio, and **a link to LinkedIn/X**.\n\nEvery time I apply this to a site that wasn't doing it, posts climb 4-8 positions within 2 weeks. Stupid easy.\n\n**3. Get listed on partner/integration marketplaces**\n\nIf your business integrates with other platforms, get listed on their marketplace. It's a free DA 90+ backlink.\n\nZapier, HubSpot App Marketplace, WordPress plugin directory, Chrome Extensions web store. These listings also drive actual users, not just SEO juice.\n\n**4. Exact domain match still works**\n\nIf you haven't started your site yet, you can get a huge SEO boost on a specific keyword if your domain matches it exactly.\n\nGoogle nerfed this years ago, but it still helps when combined with quality content. If you haven't bought your domain yet, spend an extra hour finding one with your primary keyword in it.\n\n**5. Build a free tool**\n\nCalculator, checker, generator - doesn't matter. People love linking to useful resources. One weekend project can earn you backlinks for years.\n\nI built a simple Domain Rating checker. It takes seconds to use, costs me almost nothing to run, and it gets linked a lot on social media.\n\n**6. Fresh, regular content**\n\nGoogle rewards sites that publish consistently. It signals your site is active and worth crawling frequently. Each article = new entry point from search.\n\n**7. Find keyword gaps**\n\nEveryone tells you to copy competitors. But the real opportunity is what they're *not* doing.\n\nFind terms competitors aren't targeting well. One overlooked keyword with decent volume can become your traffic goldmine while everyone else fights over high-competition terms.\n\nI've seen single well-chosen keywords bring 80% of total traffic on niche sites.\n\n**8. NAP consistency**\n\nYour brand name, URL, and social links should be identical everywhere: Google Business Profile, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, X, directories.\n\nWhen Google sees the same info repeated across trusted sources, it builds confidence you're legitimate. Inconsistencies create doubt.\n\n**9. Curated directories only**\n\nIf it's free and anyone can post, don't expect much. Generic directories are worthless.\n\nWhat works: Product Hunt, G2, Capterra, \"There's an AI for That\", industry-specific directories that actually vet submissions or require payment.\n\n**10. Programmatic SEO**\n\nOne template + structured data = thousands of pages targeting long-tail keywords.\n\nClassic example: Zapier's integration pages. But you need a decent backlink profile first, or these pages won't rank.\n\n**11. FAQ sections**\n\nFAQs let you target long-tail keywords and qualify for rich snippets. More SERP real estate = higher CTR.\n\nEven more important now with AI search. When AI fans out your query into sub-queries, FAQ content formatted as Q&amp;A is exactly what they're looking for.\n\n**12. Backlinks outreach**\n\nCold outreach still works:\n\n* Guest posting (you provide content, they get a backlink)\n* Broken link replacement (find broken links on relevant sites, suggest your content)\n* Unlinked mentions (find articles mentioning you without linking, ask for the link)\n\nIt's time consuming. But it works. The only downside to traditional link exchanges is that when scaled, reciprocal links can look suspicious to Google. Site A links to B, B links back to A. Google knows it's a trade.\n\nIf you want to automate link building, I built an ABC backlink exchange into BlogSEO. Users get matched with sites in similar niches and the system inserts contextual backlinks using a triangle structure (A→B→C→A) so there's no direct reciprocation. No cold outreach &amp; no reciprocal penalty.\n\n**13. Comparison pages**\n\n\"\\[Competitor\\] alternatives\" and \"\\[Competitor\\] vs \\[Your brand\\]\" searches are bottom-of-funnel gold. These people have already decided to buy - they're just picking which option.\n\nBe honest in these. If you're worse at something, say it. Builds trust and filters out bad-fit customers.\n\n**14. Schema markup that matters**\n\nMost sites skip this or add useless generic markup. Three that actually help:\n\n* `Person`/`Author` \\- links content to a real human\n* `FAQPage` \\- qualifies for rich snippets\n* `SameAs` \\- tells Google all places your brand exists\n\nIf you do this, and are patient enough, I can guarantee you'll get more organic traffic within 3 months.\n\nHappy to answer questions if needed!",

    "selftext": "After analyzing data from 20 brands and 1000+ AI citations, the writing is on the wall: **traditional SEO is dead for AI search.**\n\nWe're witnessing the biggest shift in search since Google's PageRank algorithm. But instead of optimizing for search engines, we're now optimizing for **Generative Engines** – ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overviews.\n\nWelcome to the era of **GEO: Generative Engine Optimization.**\n\n# The Death of Traditional SEO Metrics in AI\n\nHere's what shocked me most in recent research: **Classic SEO metrics have almost zero correlation with AI visibility.**\n\n* Domain Authority? Weak correlation (0.326)\n* Backlinks? Even weaker (0.218)\n* Organic traffic? Barely matters (0.274)\n\nThe AI engines don't care about your DA50 website or your 10,000 backlinks. They're playing by completely different rules.\n\n# The New GEO Ranking Factors That Actually Matter\n\nAfter analyzing thousands of AI citations, three factors dominate AI search visibility:\n\n# 1. Brand Web Mentions (Correlation: 0.664)\n\n**This is the strongest predictor of AI visibility.**\n\nAI engines scan the entire web for context about your brand. Every unlinked mention, every casual reference, every piece of coverage matters more than traditional backlinks.\n\n*Action item: Focus on PR, thought leadership, and getting your brand mentioned across diverse publications – linked or unlinked.*\n\n# 2. Content Depth + Readability (10x More Citations)\n\nThe most-cited content in AI has:\n\n* 10,000+ words vs 3,900 words for low-cited content\n* Higher sentence counts (1,500+ vs 580)\n* Better readability scores (Flesch Score 55+ vs 48)\n\n*Action item: Create comprehensive, deep-dive content that thoroughly answers questions. Think encyclopedia entries, not blog posts.*\n\n# 3. Brand Search Volume (Correlation: 0.334-0.542)\n\n**Popularity is everything in AI search.**\n\nIf people aren't actively searching for your brand, AI engines won't surface you. It's a winner-takes-all game where visibility breeds more visibility.\n\n*Action item: Invest in brand awareness campaigns that drive people to search for your company name specifically.*\n\n# The AI Citation Multiplier Effect\n\nHere's the data that'll blow your mind:\n\n**Brands in the top 25% for web mentions average 169 AI citations – that's 10X more than the next quartile (14 citations).**\n\nIf you're in the bottom 50% of web mentions? You're essentially invisible to AI systems.\n\n# Platform-Specific GEO Strategies\n\nDifferent AI engines have distinct preferences:\n\n**ChatGPT** (Highest traffic sender):\n\n* Strongest correlation with brand search volume (0.542)\n* Prefers popular, digitally-native brands\n* Most likely to cite comprehensive content\n\n**Perplexity** (Highest brand mention frequency):\n\n* Values word count and sentence depth\n* Shows highest brand diversity in responses\n* More likely to surface niche experts\n\n**Google AI Overviews** (Integrated with web rankings):\n\n* Combines traditional SEO signals with AI preferences\n* No opt-out option (unlike other platforms)\n* Highest brand diversity in results\n\n# The GEO Content Formula\n\nBased on analyzing 1000+ citations, here's what AI engines actually want:\n\n***Comprehensive Coverage + Readability + Brand Authority = AI Visibility***\n\n**Winning Example**: A unique experience travel article  with 10,000+ words, 1,200+ sentences, and a Flesch Score of 55 received 72 ChatGPT citations.\n\n**Losing Example**: Similar topic, same niche, but only 3,500 words and 550 sentences received just 3 citations.\n\n# Technical GEO Traps to Avoid\n\n**Critical warning**: Many brands are accidentally sabotaging their AI visibility:\n\n* **Blocking AI crawlers** in robots.txt (check yours now!)\n* **CDN settings** preventing LLM access\n* **Geographic restrictions** that block AI training data collection\n* **Missing indexation** in Bing (affects Copilot visibility)\n\n# The Prompt Psychology Factor\n\n**69.71% of brand mentions** happen when prompts include the word \"best.\"\n\nOther trigger words:\n\n* \"Trusted\" (5.77%)\n* \"Source\" (2.88%)\n* \"Recommend\" (0.96%)\n* \"Reliable\" (0.96%)\n\nUnderstanding how users phrase questions to AI is becoming as important as keyword research was for Google.\n\n# My GEO Action Plan (Start Today)\n\n**Week 1**: Audit your AI visibility\n\n* Search for your brand in ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity\n* Check if you're blocked in robots.txt\n* Measure current brand mention volume\n\n**Week 2**: Content depth audit\n\n* Identify your thin content (under 3,000 words)\n* Plan comprehensive content pieces (8,000+ words)\n* Focus on readability and structure\n\n**Week 3**: Brand mention strategy\n\n* Launch PR campaign for unlinked mentions\n* Create thought leadership content\n* Partner with other brands for cross-mentions\n\n**Month 2**: Monitor and optimize\n\n* Track AI citations monthly\n* Test different content depths\n* Measure brand search volume growth\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\n**SEO optimized for algorithms. GEO optimizes for intelligence.**\n\nWhile everyone else is still playing the old backlink game, smart marketers are building comprehensive content libraries and generating brand buzz across the web.\n\nThe future belongs to brands that understand this shift. AI engines don't just index your website – they understand your entire digital footprint.\n\n**The question isn't whether AI will change search. It's whether you'll adapt before your competitors do.**",

Are you bailing on the industry altogether? Are you finding a way to leverage LLM's to make yourself even more valuable as a writer?\n\nPersonally, if the agency I work for takes an axe to the content department, I’m planning to fall back on my skills as a former Chef, and maybe start making YouTube content revolving around using Chat-GPT for writing, for fun.",

    "selftext": "I've been writing blog posts for the last few years. Over time, I've come up with a good system that actually has a soul and not just pieced together purely for SEO that no one would enjoy reading.\n\nHere it is: \n\n1. Work out the title I’m going to write - like is it going to be an ultimate guide, best practices etc.  \n2. Read through 10-20 already written blog posts + additional research outside of the SERPs to deeply understand the topic.  \n3. Pull out bullet points of the interesting bits. Have a Notion page to organize this.  \n4. List out my angle so I can remind myself that I’m not just re-iterating stuff from other posts but have a different eye. For this one it’s specifically for B2B SaaS and things I’ve seen work. Most other articles cover eCommerce etc. use cases which a SaaS marketer wouldn’t care about.  \n5. Roughly list out the sections I’ll write based on the SERPs. Just the headings and some bullet points.  \n6. (This is the outline done)  \n7. Pull up tone reference. I LOVE marketermilk \\[dot\\] com’s tone. It is very friendly with good structure for SEO. I have this open the whole time I’ writing.  \n8. I start with a good opening story. Had 2 different options for this one. Bullet points to expand on later since sometimes as you’re writing, the story up top changes.  \n9. Have 2-3 other blog posts/references open to pull in insights from as I’m writing.  \n10. Then it’s just writing to fill up each section. I try to give out hidden gems, things that only a deep expert would know instead of plain-old click here click there. In this post, I talked about give your team “Full” access because that’s what I do. People appreciate this.  \n11. I add contextual images along the way with annotations and add alt tags in a way that when screen readers read it, it makes sense as a sentence.  \n12. I try to start every section off with an overview of what the reader will learn upfront.  \n13. Paragraphs should have less than 3 sentences. Any time there is a long list of items, I immediately delete and make it a list because it’s much easier on the eyes.  \n14. Instead of a conclusion that just reiterates what you read I do a Next Steps to provide a jumping off point.  \n15. I leave sentences half-written when they are obvious what they are going to be about and move to other sections.  \n16. At the end I do a full read through, complete sentences and only edit and then do another fixing/rewriting.  \n17. I have Grammarly turned on the whole time to provide edits\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's your writing process?",

    "selftext": "\n#1. Instagram is back to prioritising Photos \n\nAfter many rants against Instagram to stop pushing reels. The platform has stopped prioritising reels as majority of people are getting less reach through reels. \n\nBut the impact of This hasn’t been that much on images. Many users have been saying they are getting more photos reach than usual but majority is still suffering from organic reach from both reels &amp; images. \n\n**What Meta has to say:** Mark &amp; Instagram CEO have said that use of AI has increased in recommending users more relevant content. And they have a better system now to determine what type of content deserves to be on explore page or recommendation section in Home page. \n\n#2. TikTok’s Carousel format is organic but it’s bad \n\nLast year, Business insider talked to Tiktok team and they found out that tiktok is trying to make an average user more engaging &amp; trying to be like Instagram to make the platform easier to post content. \n\nWhich lead to Tiktok launching carousels to make it easier to post imagery content. And since the launch, this format is more organic than any other feature on platform. \n\nBut again the problem here is adult content, people are adding adult imagery content in between images to escape the content violation. \n\nOverall it’s organic for businesses to use now but at the same time children are getting pitched adult content through it. \n\n***Another Good news:*** Tiktok announced “Sound for Business” update to make it easier to use sounds without legal approvals. Bc\n\n#3. Pinterest’s New Ad Format is game changing \n\nPinterest is very limited as your industry defines how well your Ads will perform. But to target a broad audience, they have introduced a premium Ad spot. \n\nYou can book a 24-hour spot on Pinterest search page where the platform will preview your Ad for a whole day. This format is a great opportunity for advertisers to generate brand awareness. But still the format if is expanded to more &amp; more advertisers. It can change how Pinterest advertising works for a business. \n\n#4. Newsletters are the future of LinkedIn &amp; WhatsApp \n\nLinkedIn is doing a great job with Newsletters &amp; they have added features like one-click subscribe to make it easier for people to subscribe. \n\nWhatsApp is also working on newsletters feature to help WhatsApp communities &amp; Brands reach their audiences more frequently and get better conversions. \n\nThe reason newsletters are growing, the content deliverability is improved and brands can reach their followers without dependence on the algorithm. \n\nSocial media platforms working on adding newsletter &amp; community features like IG broadcasts is better for organic growth. \n\nBut at the same time bad for advertising business, these same platforms want you to pay to reach your audience. But that’s also the reason we are seeing rise of paid subscriptions on social media platforms. \n\n#5. Social Marketing is Changing to Community Building \n\nAs I mentioned above social media platforms are moving to paid subscriptions. And that’s a threat to advertisers because there are many challenges coming up like \n\n* Data laws in EU \n* CPM goes higher every year \n* Paid subscription users  \n* Short-form content requiring more efforts \n\nLast year not a single platform expect Tiktok showed growth in terms of Ad revenue. \n\nThat’s why platforms have been moving to paid subscriptions. And are brands successful with paid features? \n\n* LinkedIn have 236 million paid users\n* Snapchat crossed 2 million users in less than a year since the launch of their paid plan. \n* Meta (IG &amp; FB) is expected to have 100 million paid users by 2025. \n* Twitter Blue was a failure before but the numbers are increasing. \n* Reddit is steadily acquiring more users \n\nNow, Meta has promised advertisers that the paid subscriptions won’t affect advertising business.\n\nBut thinking from Meta’s POV &amp; other platforms, the revenue from subscriptions is easier to grab &amp; lesser work. \n\nWhich leads us to what marketers are doing to survive the changes is community building. \n\nIt’s important to have control over your audience. And that’s why they are focusing on move audiences to private communities, newsletters &amp; platforms like Discord &amp; Slack. To make sure they listen to their audience better &amp; more consistently. \n\nAnd it doesn’t matter Meta, Tiktok or Snapchat get rid of advertisers or ignore them. Community building is one of the important part of social marketing. \n\n#6. Wrapping up with Three other marketing trends regarding Social Media \n\nMeme Marketing is becoming a bigger part of social media strategies as for short form content. Brands have started valuing engagement over conversions. \n\nSocial media managers are taking over influencer roles for brands as the budgets for influencer marketing are shrinking due to recession &amp; inflation. \n\nPeople are calling out human written content as AI wrote it &amp; doubting every single piece of content they see.\n\n\n**These posts are sometimes deleted due to mod hate, like one of my post got deleted two days ago with no warnings.

    "title": "7 marketing trends for 2026",
    "selftext": "**1. Marketers become product managers**\n\nIn 2026, being a marketer means you become more valuable to businesses.\n\nAs AI vibe coding tools keep lowering the barrier to building products, winning attention and trust becomes the hardest problem. That puts marketing at the center of the company.\n\nMarketing is no longer just campaigns, case studies, or social posts. It goes beyond visibility.\n\nThe shift is that marketers start acting like product managers and product builders.\n\nTools like v0, Lovable, Google AI Studio, Cursor, and similar platforms are not just for developers. They allow marketers to turn product ideas into real prototypes.\n\nHistorically, product managers often lacked deep domain knowledge. Marketers usually have it. These tools let marketers build based on real customer insight.\n\nPrototyping becomes a core marketing skill. Product is easier to build. Marketing is harder. Marketing has to be embedded into product development.\n\nThe output may not be production ready, but it is good enough to hand off to engineers.\n\nThis is already happening. Roles like Vibe Growth Marketing Manager and full stack marketer are emerging.\n\nMarketing skill sets are becoming more valuable. Do not undersell yourself.\n\n\n\n**2. SEO blogging makes a comeback for AEO**\n\nIn 2024 and early 2025, SEO is dead narratives came back. This time there was real fear due to AI search.\n\nSome companies lost traffic and were very vocal. Others quietly kept growing.\n\nIn 2025 at the Ahrefs conference, many people were still crushing it with niche blogs and never talking about it publicly.\n\nBlogging is not dead. Especially for AI answer engines.\n\nChatGPT and Perplexity cite blog content heavily. In 2026, blog posts based on lived experience and real humans matter more.\n\nThe focus shifts to bottom of funnel content.\n\nInstead of broad topics like what is a CRM, the focus becomes comparisons and specific use cases like best CRMs for agencies.\n\nTraffic matters less than conversion. Hyper specific content wins.\n\n\n\n**3. Marketers become internal influencers**\n\nIn 2025, UGC and creator content exploded. That continues.\n\nBut companies are now activating their own employees as creators. Companies like Clay and Ahrefs have employees producing top of funnel content.\n\nThis reduces influencer costs and improves message quality. Marketing and content creation merge. Product marketing skill becomes essential.\n\nThe better you understand the product and audience, the more valuable you become. Becoming the face of a product area makes you defensible in your career.\n\n\n\n**4. AI video ads keep getting better**\n\nIn 2025, generative video models like Sora changed advertising.\n\nBig brands are experimenting with AI generated ads.  The advantage is not the tool. It is storytelling, narrative, and taste.\n\nThis ties back to marketers acting like creators and product thinkers. Strong creative direction is required to make AI work.\n\n\n\n**5. Network effects become a marketing moat**\n\nEverything is becoming a commodity. The differentiator is distribution built into the product.\n\nGrowth loops are the moat. Facebook grew through social connections. n8n grows through community templates. Customers become marketers. The output feeds back into input and compounds.\n\n\n\n**6. Design taste becomes the number one marketing skill**\n\nDesign is not just visuals. It is clarity, simplicity, and emotional response.\n\nAwe matters in a world flooded with AI generated content. Design applies to websites, prototypes, blog structure, scripts, and flows. Taste is the competitive advantage.\n\nEveryone can generate content. Few can design meaningful experiences. Care deeply. Be methodical. Design for humans.\n\n\n\n**7. Human first media becomes top ad real estate**\n\nPeople trust people, not brands.\n\nMedia businesses built by individuals are becoming extremely valuable. Marketing is catching up to the creator economy.If you know an industry well, build a media asset around it.\n\nBlogs, newsletters, YouTube, LinkedIn all work. Competition is lower than it looks. Trust compounds. Companies sponsor, partner with, and acquire trusted media brands.\n\nMedia becomes both a marketing channel and a career asset.",

    "selftext": "I've been running AI content experiments across 73 of my blog website for the past year. 60% sites tanked completely, others are crushing it. Here's what I figured out.\n\nThrowing cheap AI content at your blog can survive even for short terms. I watched several of my sites get buried because . But there's a way to make it work.\n\nWhat was the Difference?\n\nPick Your AI Tool Carefully\n\n* ChatGPT isn't automatically the best choice\n* I tested like 18 different AI writers before settling on anything\n* Claude kept giving me better results than the others\n* Don't just go with what everyone's talking about\n\nAnswer Search Intent Fast  \nIf you want featured snippets or decent Google rankings, answer the search intent immediately in the first viewport after someone lands on your blog. Don't bury the answer.\n\nI use this \"tee up and answer\" format where I set up the question, then hit them with tons of facts, figures, data, and technical details. NOT generic answers. AI loves giving generic fluff - you have to review and edit that out.\n\nContent Structure:\n\n* No wall of text\n* Break everything down into small chunks with ratios as : 10-15% tables, 20-30% lists, 50-60% short paragraphs\n* Keep paragraphs to 3-4 lines max or under 400 characters\n* Use subheadings like your reader's attention span depends on it\n\nVisuals:\n\n* Get unique images when you can\n* Grab images from authority sites (just cite them properly)\n* Make custom infographics with AI tools\n* Embed relevant videos throughout\n* Use quality AI image generators\n\nNo Synthetic Data\n\n* Pack your posts with real facts, figures, and citations\n* Link to authoritative sources\n* Never use synthetic or made-up data (Google will punish you hard)\n* Real statistics build real authority\n\nKeyword Research That Actually Works:  \nHere's where most people mess up. Everyone's chasing high-volume keywords that are impossible to rank for.\n\nI go after zero-volume and low-volume keywords that everyone else ignores. Look for untargeted keywords with geo potential - sometimes these \"worthless\" keywords are absolute goldmines.\n\nUse Google auto-suggest and the alphabet soup strategy (type your keyword + a, then + b, etc.)+ other prefix and suffix stragetigies to find low-competition keywords. No tool can help you at this level of keyword research, you have to do it manually. And you WILL get traffic from here for sure.\n\nSocial media:\n\nHelp community , solve people problem Post helpful content , help community to the related sector of the Blog, help them in whatever way possible, build the trust and eventually it will make your website a brand and word of mouth spread\n\n# \n\nFinally , i want to wrap up , AI content works brilliantly if you don't treat it like a magic button and have well structed strategies for each and everything .\n\nMy best-performing blogs now get 10x more traffic than before I started this experiment, but only because I failed Several blogs and Broken lot of things and lot of times",
