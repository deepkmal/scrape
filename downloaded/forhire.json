    "selftext": "I’m sharing this because I still see a lot of new freelancers getting caught up in shady or time-wasting job offers. If you’re new, please read this, these are common red flags I’ve noticed (and others have pointed out too).\n\n🚩 **Red Flags to Watch Out For**\n\n**Vague + overpromising posts**\n\nExample: “Data entry, earn $40–$120/day.” No details, just high pay for easy work. That’s a red flag.\n\n**Suspiciously new accounts**\n\nNot all new accounts are scams, but often these posts come from users with:\n- Only 1 post (usually vague)\n- No comment history\n- Recently created accounts\n\n**Weird contact info, like WhatsApp/TG**\n\nIf the number’s name doesn’t match their WA/TG username, or the country code looks unusual, be cautious. Many scammers pretend to be “employers” but are actually just recruiters collecting data.\n\n**Overly generic or copy-paste job posts**\n\nSome posts look like they were auto-generated and not even reviewed. AI-assisted posts aren’t bad by themselves, but scammers and time-wasters often put out vague, incomplete, or overpromising listings that don’t explain the actual job.\n\n👉 If you clarify with them and their reply is still vague or evasive, trust your gut and move on. Real clients usually know (or can explain) what they want.\n\n**Fake “test tasks” that are actually the real job**\n\nSome posts ask you to complete a “sample” before paying, like rewriting part of a PDF, doing lead searches, or transcribing a few pages. Be careful: if 10 people each submit a “sample,” the scammer now has 100 leads/pages done for free and will ghost everyone.\n\n👉 Legitimate clients might ask for small samples, but it should never be full or substantial work. A good rule: if the sample looks like billable work, don’t do it without a contract or partial payment first.\n\n**Ghosting or “collecting applicants”**\n\nSome posts are just made to farm responses. They’ll vanish, never reply, or ask for “samples” before confirming anything. Don’t waste time if they can’t be clear up front.\n\nIf you’re unsure, **ask in the sub before applying**. Experienced freelancers here can help you double-check.\n\nHope this helps you save time and protect you. If something feels “off,” it usually is. Don’t be afraid to walk away. There will always be better, safer opportunities.",
