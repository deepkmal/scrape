    "selftext": "My uncle, who has not one but two PhDs, reads one book a week. Some of my fondest memories with him were our trips bashing about London, going to every used bookstore. He reads everything, from politics to history to cooking to books on how to write. It always amazed me as a boy, though I didn’t understand why he read SO much. He reads more than anyone else I ever met before or since. So I asked once in my teenage years why he kept on reading so much well into his fifties and sixties. Here’s what he told me:\n\n“Lad, I don’t remember 90% of the material I’ve read. I’m not reading to memorise certain facts or to have a bank of useful information to pull from later. I read because it’s edifying. It changes the way I think, even if just for a moment, and what the brain forgets, the body remembers. I’m a different person now than I would have been had I not read so much, even if the majority of the content is wiped clean from my memory. Don’t read to learn for the future; read to learn right now. It will change you and your perspective without you ever noticing. That’s why I read and will continue to read.” \n\nYou ever have a moment that’s life changing, even if you don’t realise it at the time? That was one of those fundamental, core moments for me. Even now, 15 years later, I still aim to read a book a week (though admittedly it takes me a bit longer than my uncle). And after reading hundreds of books, articles, and essays in my life, I can say that he was right. I don’t remember hardly any of what I read, but that’s ok. Reading has changed me in ways I couldn’t imagine. It’s widen my interests, my perspective, my vocabulary. And I know without a doubt I would not be who I am today had I not read so much. \n\nDon’t read to learn for the future. Read to learn now. Your mind will forget most of what you learn, but the core foundation of who you are will remember.",

At first, it felt pointless. But after a few weeks, I started noticing patterns.

I am a software dev who also do the product management at my company. And I hate doing \"research\" on features.\n\nThe weird thing is, just being aware of these patterns made them easier to deal with.

    "selftext": "Hey r/productivity! I wanted to share an experiment I tried recently that honestly changed my relationship with time-wasting and learning.\n\nLike many of you, I used to mindlessly scroll through social media whenever I had a few spare minutes - waiting for coffee, on the bus, or even (embarrassingly) on the toilet. One day, I calculated I was spending about 2.5 hours daily just... scrolling.\n\nSo I decided to try something different: replacing every social media urge with a 5-10 minute learning session. Here's what I did:\n\n**My Setup:**\n\n* Deleted social apps from my phone\n* Downloaded: Duolingo, Brilliant, and a Kindle app\n* Bookmarked some educational Yt channels\n* Installed Pocket for saving interesting articles\n\n**What I learned in 30 days:**\n\n* Basic conversational Spanish (15-20 phrases I can actually use)\n* Finally understood how compound interest actually works\n* Basics of stock market and investing\n* Read 2 full books in \"bite-sized\" chunks\n* Learned to solve a Rubik's cube (via short yt tutorials)\n\n**The Unexpected Benefits:**\n\n1. Better sleep - no more late-night scrolling\n2. Reduced anxiety - less FOMO, more actual accomplishment\n3. Better conversations - I actually had interesting things to share\n4. Increased focus - my attention span noticeably improved\n\n**The Challenges:**\n\n* First week was HARD. My thumb literally twitched for Instagram\n* Had to fight the urge to turn learning into another mindless activity\n* Sometimes felt disconnected from friends' daily updates\n* Needed to actively plan what I wanted to learn\n\n**Tips if you want to try:**\n\n* Start with topics you're genuinely curious about\n* Keep learning sessions under 10 minutes\n* Have multiple options ready (different apps/materials)\n* Don't beat yourself up if you slip up\n\nThe biggest surprise? After 30 days, I didn't even want to go back to my old social media habits. I still use them, but now it's intentional and limited.\n\n**TLDR:** Replaced mindless scrolling with mini-learning sessions. Learned actual skills, felt more productive, and broke my social media addiction.\n\nHas anyone else tried something similar?",

    "selftext": ".\n\nTired of feeling like you're constantly fighting an uphill battle against procrastination? I've been there. For years, I felt like I was stuck in a cycle of endless distractions and a complete lack of motivation. I'd want to get things done, need to get things done, but somehow, I'd always find myself sucked into the black hole of social media or mindlessly scrolling through Netflix.\nI thought I was lazy. I'd beat myself up, call myself undisciplined, and generally feel like a complete failure. But then, I started to learn about the science behind it all – the role of dopamine in motivation and how our modern world is designed to constantly hijack our reward systems.\nIt clicked. I wasn't lazy; I was dopamine-depleted. My brain was constantly craving the instant gratification of likes, notifications, and quick wins, leaving me feeling drained and unmotivated for anything that required sustained effort.\nSound familiar?\nThe good news is, you can break free. It takes time and effort, but you can absolutely rewire your brain and cultivate the discipline you crave.\nHere's what helped me:\n * Digital Detox: I started small. I'd put my phone on \"Do Not Disturb\" for an hour in the morning, then gradually increased the duration. I deleted social media apps from my phone and replaced them with reading apps or meditation apps.\n * Embrace Boredom: I know, it sounds counterintuitive, but allowing myself to experience periods of boredom actually increased my creativity and forced me to find other ways to entertain myself.\n * Mindful Moments: I started incorporating mindfulness practices like meditation and deep breathing into my daily routine. It helped me become more aware of my thoughts and feelings, and better able to resist the urge to constantly seek out distractions.\n * The Power of Small Wins: I broke down large, overwhelming tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Completing these smaller tasks gave me a sense of accomplishment and kept me motivated to keep going.\nIt wasn't easy, and there were definitely setbacks along the way. But with consistent effort and a focus on building sustainable habits, I've been able to significantly improve my focus, productivity, and overall well-being.\nYou can do it too.\nStart small, be patient with yourself, and celebrate your progress.\nI'm here for you. Let me know in the comments if you have any questions or want to share your own experiences.\nDisclaimer: This post is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

    "selftext": "\nAfter my last post about dopamine depletion resonated with so many of you, I wanted to share the practical steps that actually helped me rewire my brain. No theoretical fluff – just real, tested methods from someone who's been in the trenches.\n\nLet me be real with you: implementing these changes wasn't smooth sailing. There were days I fell back into old patterns, moments of frustration, and times I questioned if it was worth it. But looking back now, these strategies fundamentally changed how I approach life and productivity.\n\nHere's what actually worked for me:\n\n* Morning Sanctuary: I replaced the instant phone grab with 30 minutes of peace. Just water, window gazing, and letting my mind settle. The first week was torture – my hand would literally twitch toward my phone. Now? It's the most peaceful part of my day. The urge to check notifications eventually fades, I promise.\n\n* Movement Medicine: Skip the intense workout pressure. I discovered that simple movement – like walking without podcasts or dancing badly while making breakfast – gives me a more sustainable dopamine boost than endless doomless scrolling ever did. Your body literally rewards you for basic movement, no gym membership required.\n\n* Real Connection Reset: Having coffee with friends, phones face-down, felt weirdly uncomfortable at first. Those silent moments where we'd usually hide in our screens? They turned into the deepest conversations I've had in years. The human connection hits different when you're fully present.\n\n* Analog Joy: Found myself picking up origami (of all things). There's something deeply satisfying about creating something physical with your hands. Whether it's drawing, writing in a journal, or building something – tangible activities give you that dopamine hit without the digital drain.\n\n* Single-Task Revolution: Turns out, my brain wasn't designed for constant task-switching. When I work, I just work. When I rest, I actually rest (revolutionary, I know). It felt impossible at first, but like training a puppy, my mind gradually learned to stay focused.\n\n* Evening Rituals: Created a proper shutdown sequence for my day instead of streaming until my eyes blur. Sometimes it's reading an actual book, sometimes just sitting with my thoughts. My sleep quality skyrocketed, and morning-me is way less grumpy.\n\nHere's the real talk: this isn't about becoming some digital monk or never enjoying Netflix again. I still use technology, but now I'm in control, not the other way around. Some days are better than others, and that's completely okay.\n\nRemember, these changes took months, not days. Start small, be patient with yourself, and know that every tiny victory counts.\n\nDrop a comment about which strategy you're going to try first – let's keep supporting each other on this journey.\n\nEdit: Since some of you asked – yes, this is all from personal experience. The struggles, the setbacks, and the small wins are all real. Thanks for creating this space where we can have honest conversations about something we all face.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

    "selftext": "I'm embarrassed to admit it… but I've been averaging 9 hours a day on my phone for a while (mostly reels)… it literally kills my productivity and social life.\n\nHonestly it didn't even feel like that much. It just kind of happens…\n\n* Wake up: scroll (1+ hr)\n* Eat breakfast/lunch: on my phone (1+ mins)\n* Evening: watch TV while on my phone (3 hrs)\n* Lay down for bed: scroll (1+ hrs)\n* Wake up in middle of night: scroll (1+ hrs)\n* Plus using throughout the day (2 hrs)\n\nI decided to commit (hard) to making a change… basically go cold turkey... and follow a lot of the advice I've seen on reddit...\n\n**1) Hard limit of 1 hour on Insta**  \nOnce I use up the hour, I can't even open Insta. I didn't want to completely delete it because I use it to communicate with friends and I wanted to see if I could still use it but not obsessively.\n\n**2) Turned on grayscale**  \nI hate it, and don't always leave it on… but it works when I do it. It makes your phone way less addicting, and boring to use even on the addicting apps.\n\n**3) Completely block Insta and social from 7pm to 7am**  \nI racked up a lot of time while watching TV, and in the middle of the night, and in the morning — all of it was time I regretted. I still let myself watch TV at night, but at least I'm not double screening and I'm focused on just the TV which feels much more relaxing.\n\n**4) Find better replacements**  \nThis was a important one for me. Replacing scrolling with things I'd rather do (read, play guitar, call friends, study, etc).\n\n* I have a lot of books I have ordered but never read, so I'm keeping a book next to me to fill the small times.\n* I love playing music and writing music but my guitar was collecting dust. Just playing guitar a few times a day puts me in a much more creative and relaxed mood.\n* I'm calling my friends who I have not talked to in a while.\n* And, I'm learning new things (in moderation). It's so easy to bombard ourselves with too much information, so I'm picking less things and going deep on them with whatever gets me excited, and with no attachment.\n\n",

Every time I set a goal, I’d procrastinate, feel overwhelmed, and eventually give up. It was frustrating, and I started doubting if I’d ever really change.\n\nThen something clicked. I realized I was focusing too much on the end result and not enough on the small, daily steps that actually get you there. I started breaking my goals into tiny, manageable pieces and creating routines that worked for *me*. It wasn’t perfect at first, but slowly, I began to see progress.\n\nBy the end of the year, I had accomplished more than I thought possible—not because I was perfect, but because I learned how to stay consistent, even when motivation ran low.\n\nIf there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: **you don’t have to feel ready to start. Small steps, taken every day, will get you further than waiting for the “right moment.”**\n\nI’m sharing this because I know how tough it can be to feel stuck. But trust me—change is possible. You just need a plan and the willingness to take that first step.",

I came across this 4-4-4-4 Breathing technique and it has helped me since then.\n\n**How it works:** Inhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold your breath again for 4 seconds, repeat this cycle 4 times.\n\nSometimes repeating it 4 times may not be enough so I just keep on repeating it till the time I feel sleepy and then I don't even realize when I stop doing it because I’ve already fallen asleep.\n\n**Why it works:** This technique slows your heart rate, increases oxygen in your bloodstream and triggers your parasympathetic nervous system, which promotes relaxation.\n\nTry it out for yourself and thank me later :)",

    "selftext": "For years I thought I needed some “perfect” morning routine cold showers, 5am wakeups, journaling, meditation, the whole thing. I tried most of it, but honestly? It never stuck.\n\nWhat finally worked for me was embarrassingly simple. Nothing Instagram-worthy, but it cut almost an hour of wasted time out of my mornings:\n\n1. **No phone for the first 30 minutes** I used to lose 20–25 minutes scrolling before even getting out of bed. Now I leave my phone charging in the next room and use a cheap alarm clock. The difference is huge.\n2. **Batch the basics** Instead of making tiny decisions every morning (what to wear, what to eat, what bag to pack), I set up a “default.” Same breakfast (overnight oats), clothes picked the night before, bag ready at the door. Saves me at least 15 minutes of dithering.\n3. **Timers for transitions** Brushing teeth, making coffee, quick stretch.  I set a 5-minute timer for each. Weirdly, it keeps me from drifting into daydreaming or standing around.\n4. **First task = one small win** I don’t start with email. Instead, I write down one 5-minute task (like clearing my desk or reviewing today’s top 3 priorities). It creates momentum instead of dragging me into other people’s agendas.\n\n**Result:** I went from needing about 2 hours to “start my day” to 1 hour. That extra hour now goes into focused work before distractions hit, and it feels like I’m finally ahead instead of playing catch-up.\n\nNot glamorous. Not aesthetic. But it works for me.\n\nCurious, what is the simplest tweak you have made to your morning routine that saved the most time ?",

    "selftext": "When I started working, I thought being busy meant I was doing great. I'd spend hours at my desk, bouncing between emails, tabs, meetings. It felt like I was running at full speed but not actually creating much real impact.\n\nThen I switched jobs. It was a big opportunity, bigger responsibilities, faster pace, higher expectations. I was excited... and also completely overwhelmed. My ADHD brain, which already struggled with focus and follow-through, was getting hammered from all sides. Tasks piled up. Important emails got missed. I started falling behind, fast\n\nI knew if I kept going like this, it was just a matter of time before I got fired. So I got serious about fixing how I worked. I started reading books, asking people for advice, trying every method on the internet\n\nSome of it was bs. Some of it helped a little. But a few key ideas actually made a real difference. If you're feeling overwhelmed at work, these three methods changed everything for me\n\n* Getting Things Done by David Allen: The core idea is: your brain is for having ideas, not holding them. So whenever something pops up (a task, a reminder, a thought), you get it out of your head and into a trusted system. Once I did that, I could think clearly again instead of feeling like I was juggling a hundred things.\n* Indistractable by Nir Eyal: This book made me realize that distractions aren’t just about willpower. It’s about designing your environment so you don’t have to fight temptation all the time. Blocking apps, setting clear focus times, small tweaks, but they made a huge difference.\n* The One Thing by Gary Keller: Instead of trying to do everything, pick the one thing that will make the biggest impact and start there. Every morning, I’d ask myself, \"What’s the one thing I can do today that makes everything else easier?\" It’s crazy how much lighter my day felt when I focused like that.\n\nBut I’m a manager with ADHD, productivity didn’t come easy. At first, focusing for 10 minutes felt like climbing a mountain. None of this change would’ve stuck without the right tools to help me stay consistent. If you're trying to really boost your work performance, these made all the difference:\n\n* App blockers: I used Forest. It’s simple: stay off distracting apps and you grow a little tree. Weirdly, watching that tree grow was surprisingly motivating. I didn’t want to kill my tree, and it broke a lot of my autopilot habits around checking my phone.\n* Google Calendar: Simple, to block my time for focus sessions, prevent getting meetings in those slots\n* A GTD app: Saner, so far is the only one I found that turns my email into tasks, turns my brain dump into tasks and reminds me when something needs attention. For someone with ADHD, having a system to release my braindump is huge\n* A simple board at my desk: Nothing fancy. Just a little whiteboard where I write down my one task for the time. It’s right in front of me, so it’s easy to glance over and remind myself what to focus on\n* Noise-canceling headphones: Airpods Pro. Having noise-canceling headphones made deep work possible. Honestly, if you struggle with focus in open environment, this might be the best investment you can make.\n\nNone of this made me perfectly productive. I still have messy days. But now the messy days don’t turn into messy weeks. That's the real win.\n\nIf you’re reading this and struggling with productivity, I just want to say: you’re not broken. You’re not behind. And this can get better. You don’t need to apply 100 methods. You just need to find the one that fit you and start small.\n\nIf you have trick or tool that helped you become more productive, would love to hear it :)",

    "selftext": "TL;DR: Quit caffeine for 30 days. First week was brutal (headaches, brain fog, tired), but after that my focus and energy became more stable. Productivity improved, sleep got way better, and I feel less anxious. Don’t think I’m going back.\n\nLike a lot of people, I’ve been pretty dependent on caffeine for years. Coffee in the morning, another by noon, maybe another or an energy drink in the afternoon, felt like the only way to function. But I started wondering: am I actually more productive, or am I just running on fumes?\n\nSo I decided to quit caffeine for 30 days. No coffee, no tea, no energy drinks. Cold turkey. Here’s what happened:\n\nWeek 1: Absolute hell.\nHeadaches, fatigue, brain fog. Felt like I was walking through molasses. My mood tanked, and I honestly considered giving up more than once. Sleep got deeper almost immediately, but waking up was brutal.\n\n\nWeek 2: The brain fog started lifting.\nThe headaches were mostly gone, but my focus was still shaky. Interestingly, I started feeling calmer. My energy wasn’t high, but it felt more stable. Less jittery, less anxious. The main thing I noticed was that my stress levels plummeted, despite a more hectic schedule and increased workload with deadlines approaching.\n\n\nWeek 3: Natural focus kicked in.\nMy brain started working again but differently. My energy felt smoother and more consistent throughout the day. I stopped getting that afternoon crash. Sleep quality kept improving too.\n\n\nWeek 4: No desire to go back.\nI felt clearer. More in control. My productivity didn’t tank like I thought it would, it actually improved. I wasn’t riding the caffeine rollercoaster anymore.\n\n\n\nBiggest takeaway: Caffeine was masking my tiredness, not fixing it. Without it, I had to confront why I was so tired in the first place (bad sleep habits, stress, etc.). Fixing that made a bigger difference than coffee ever did. I think I'll still go back to one coffee in the morning occasionally (no more than two or three times a week), but never again to the same level as before.",

The key is to reduce your dependency on your phone be okay with living in the moment. You are so dependent on your phone for dopamine that you can't even take a shit without it. That is not okay. \n\nThen start watching your favourite movie/ show or even a youtube video without your phone in hand. Focus on what you are watching instead of scrolling. Also you aren't allowed to skip boring scenes or watch whatever your are watching by increasing the playback speed. \n\nThen start having your meals without taking your phone with you. \n\nThen don't touch your phone one hour after waking up and one hour before going to sleep. Infact, it's advised that you keep your phone out of your bedroom and use an alarm clock to wake up in the morning. This has helped so many people beat insomnia as well. \n\nThen start by leaving your phone in another room for a few hours.\n\nLastly, set a goal limit for your screentime after doing all the above tricks and its going to be so much easier than trying to reduce your screentime from 8-10 hours to 1-2 hours right off the bat. I already brought down my screentime by 50% in a few weeks by doing the first 3 things, my screentime also includes audiobooks and talking to family btw. The thing that is keeping us addicted to our phones is the fact that we aren't okay with being bored and start scrolling the moment we don't have anything to do instead of sitting still. \n\nIts advisable to do things step by step as the first step is the easiest and then it gets tougher from there on. Start small to reduce your screentime. Start listening to smaller audiobooks if you want to get into the habit of reading. Then start listening to longer ones. Then start reading actual books. \n",

    "title": "How I went from worst procrastinator ever to extremely productive",
    "selftext": "To preface, I used to be the WORST procrastinator ever and was in active addiction this time last year. I am not exaggerating. examples:\n\n* I wrote my entire 9,000 word dissertation in 7 hours the day it was due. Yes. I am stupid I know. (and made the project it was written for in a week)\n* Had to get an extension on every piece of coursework I completed last academic year. \n* Would procrastinate even reading the brief of an assignment because it looked hard, multiple times only read the brief the day it was due.\n* &lt;10% attendance in my classes\n* Alcoholic tendencies, drinking every day, taking weed 3/4 times a week\n\nSince the beginning of this academic year (September 2024) I have pretty much done a complete 180:\n\n* I look at all my assignments as soon as they're released, and make a calendar planning out all the relevant due dates in a semester so I know in advance what weeks will be busy.\n* I complete most individual assignments at least a few days before they're due, starting them at least 2 weeks before the due date.\n* 70%+ attendance! (I still struggle with this sometimes)\n* significantly less levels of academic stress, more time for my hobbies and completing side projects to add to my CV.\n* Drinking once a week/fortnight in social setting, weed once a month.\n\nSo, how did I go from a high functioning addict to attending most of my classes, being productive and actually *enjoying* studying again? what worked for me might not work for you and my circumstances might differ from yours but I believe the biggest factor was **addressing the root cause of my procrastination and fear of studying.** \n\nFor me, when my mental health and productivity was suffering, I was under a lot of toxic shame. Toxic shame traps you in a cycle of believing you are incapable, not completing work because of this belief, your grades suffering because of not completing work and you become actually incapable and it continues... etc. (If you're interested Heidi Priebe has a great video about it) \n\nIMO, **you cannot improve your productivity if there is lingering problems with your mental health.**\n\nWhat made the biggest differences for me when addressing toxic shame and becoming better was the following: \n\n* Spent time by myself, journalling and thinking about what circumstances made me feel shameful and useless in the first place. Following this, I made a commitment to give myself positive affirmations and combat the cycle. It was hard at first and definitely a long process, but I've gotten so much confidence back already!\n* Made a dedication to get sober because alcohol and drugs were never my problem, but my solution. Again here is it really important to spend time thinking about WHY you are abusing substances to begin with. \n* Slowly integrated myself with going outside every day again. Was scary, weird and hard and sometimes I'm still incredibly anxious going to class but whats important is the commitment to show up everyday. \n* Allowed myself to realise I was sabotaging my own success with procrastination. Once I realised this, and allowed myself to experience doing schoolwork without mountains of pressure from leaving it until last minute I felt an incredible amount of relief. It was like I didn't understand why I'd ever procrastinated before. \n* Reward myself for overcoming addiction, going further and being more in touch with myself. I allowed myself time to game, watch tv, lie in bed doing nothing- the same things I was doing before I procrastinated, just without that horrible guilty feeling!!\n* Help and support from people I love- my amazing partner has been a huge help with me getting sober, becoming a better version of myself and building a future for both of us. He saw me at my worst and now he gets to see me slowly becoming an academic weapon again!\n\nFriends who have known me for years are surprised at how different I am in just 6 months. I am slowly phasing out of fitting the criteria for C-PTSD. It's amazing what you can do when you stop running away from yourself, let yourself heal and really WANT to be better.  If someone like me can turn their life around, I truly believe anyone can. I don't find myself waiting for the next time I can get high is, now I find myself waiting to get an internship offer. And it feels really, really good. \n\nTL;DR confront your mental health to be the best version of yourself! If you have any questions, please feel free to drop them below or share your thoughts (:",

    "title": "I understimulated my overstimulated brain for 10 days, and it was fun",
    "selftext": "A couple of days back, I came across a yt video titled “understimulating my overstimulated brain.” And it intrigued me.\n\nThe video talked about how we’re always anxious and never bored anymore. Think about it, when was the last time you were truly bored? Not the “ugh, this routine is dull” kind of bored, but the “I have absolutely nothing to do” kind of bored. \n\nFor me, that was probably when I was a kid. These days I’m always occupied. My brain is constantly engaged, there’s always something to watch, something to listen to, something to scroll through.\n\nIn the video, the creator took a 7-day challenge to get bored. No internet. No devices. She even added an hour of an intentionally boring task like reading the instruction manual of a washing machine, to take it up a notch. \n\nSo, I decided to do the same. Ofc, I couldn’t go completely off the grid because, well, gotta pay bills. But I restricted whatever I could. \n\nNo social media. No entertaining content. No music. No podcasts. No audiobooks.\n\nWhat was allowed? Work-related videos and articles. Books too (tho I didn’t read a single page lol).\n\n\\----------------\n\nDay 1: It was really hard. Like, really, really hard. I felt empty, like something major was missing. I always had my meals with a screen in front of me and suddenly, it wasn’t there. I always had something playing in the background while doing boring tasks, well, now no more. Somehow, there was so much silence, yet so much noise in my head.\n\nDays 2 &amp; 3: Still tough. Still felt weird. My brain kept looking for something to fill the silence.\n\nDay 4: Started to get a hang of it. Maybe even started liking (or at least accepting) the reality.\n\n\\----------------\n\nNow, a couple of things happened. \n\n1. I got insanely productive at work. Because I had nothing to do apart from my work, I was focused in a good way, not the overwhelming way. Got better ideas. I worked at 3x the speed.\n\n2. My sleep improved both in terms of quantity and quality. I struggled with falling asleep and staying asleep. This got so much better. I felt well rested after waking up.\n\n3. I felt less anxious and actually felt good about my achievements. \n\nTo give you an example, I completed a project within 3 days. If I weren’t doing the challenge, it might have taken me about 2 weeks to complete. I was so proud of myself. However, if I were using social media, I might have seen someone doing something else, something crazy and invalidating my own achievements.\n\n4. My screen time went from 9–12 hours a day down to 2–3 hours a day.\n\n\\----------------\n\nThe original plan was 7 days, but I liked it so much that I extended it to 10. \n\nOf course, I can’t (and don’t want to) stay off the internet forever. It’s been about 2-3 weeks since the challenge, and here’s how I’ve reintroduced content with some rules. \n\n1. Social media only on my laptop &gt; The interface sucks, so I naturally spend less time there.\n\n2. Fixed slots for watching content &gt; Ideally no multitasking. 2-3 hours max, either while crocheting or when I actually want to watch something and not carrying my phone around while doing chores.\n\n3. Still no apps on my phone &gt; The extra friction keeps me away from mindless scrolling.\n\nThe goal is to be more present with whatever I am doing.\n\nEdit: I tried sharing the link twice, but it got removed. \n\nVideo name: Understimulating my overstimulated brain for a week by Michelle Gia ",

    "selftext": "I've experimented a bit over the past 6 months with various ways to cut back on doom scrolling. I came across a few reddit posts that inspired me to try things like a 24-hour detox, or even 10 days cutting back. It worked, but then my screen time tended to fluctuate a lot afterwards.\n\nI saw some posts about the idea of a 30 day plan. Having 4 separate weekly plans made it more digestible. In case it's helpful, wanted to share. Random Redditors have given me pretty good inspiration to make changes so maybe I can do the same.\n\nThis was my strategy:  \n  \n\\- First, each Sunday I would pick out a few productive things for the week that I would use to replace my mindless scrolling and track it (ex: reading, steps walked, calls made to family, etc). Then the next Sunday I could review what I accomplished with that time and revamp the plan (was very motivating and eye opening).\n\n\\- The second part of the strategy was adding a lot of friction to my phone usage. I know if I don't have boundaries I'll slip.\n\n**Week 1:**  \n\\- 25 unblocks of social media per day  \n\\- Morning and evening phone downtime (unblock as many times as I want for up to 15 minutes)  \n\\- Target of 120 phone pickups/day  \n\\- Used grayscale manually  \n  \n\\- Result: 7 hrs/day, 123 pickups/day (7 hours gained)  \n\n\n**Week 2:**  \n\\- 20 unblocks of social media per day  \n\\- Morning and evening phone downtime (unblock as many times as I want for up to 15 minutes)  \n\\- Target of 100 phone pickups/day  \n\\- Used grayscale manually  \n  \n\\- Result: 5.5 hrs/day, 102 pickups/day (17 hours gained)  \n\n\n**Week 3:**  \n\\- 10 unblocks of social media per day  \n\\- Morning and evening phone downtime (unblock 3x for up to 15 minutes)  \n\\- Target of 75 phone pickups/day  \n\\- Set up grayscale to kick in automatically at sunset  \n  \n\\- Result: 3.5 hrs/day, 77 pickups/day (30 hours gained)  \n\n\n**Week 4:**  \n\\- 5 unblocks of social media per day  \n\\- Morning and evening phone downtime (no unblocking allowed)  \n\\- Target of 50 phone pickups/day  \n\\- Grayscale to kick in automatically at sunset  \n  \n\\- Result: 2 hrs/day, 55 pickups/day (42 hours gained)  \n\n\nThe amount of time I've unlocked is staggering.

    "title": "Procrastination is Caused by Emotion, Nothing Else. Here's How to Deal.",
    "selftext": "Procrastination isn't caused by poor time management, so there's no time management system in the world that will help you fix it. Procrastination is not a moral failing, nor a lack of discipline. Trying to appeal to your willpower and push through won't work. Procrastination isn't laziness. Developing a better work ethic or better habits is not the key to success if you're a chronic procrastinator. \n\nI'm sure many of you (including me) have tried all the systems and tips out there to fix your problem, and none of them have worked. Maybe your \"new journey\" lasted all of a day or two as you tried to implement your new strategy, and then you went back to your old, procrastinating self. Feelings of guilt, shame, depression, defeat, anxiety all well up again, discouraging you from even trying. You avoid your responsibilities because they seem too hard, too painful to face. \"Why can't you just do things like normal people?\" you tell yourself. \n\nThe reason you can't is because you're overlooking the actual cause of procrastination - emotional dysregulation. If you have ADHD, a mood disorder, or are sensitive to emotion, you're going to have a hard time regulating your emotions, particularly when it comes to tasks or responsibilities that require some effort. You tend to get over-emotional about normal tasks, convincing yourself that they're harder than they are. Negative emotion about something leads to negative thoughts, which leads to procrastination. You've felt and then talked your way out of doing something. To eradicate the negative emotions, you turn to more pleasurable activities to counter them and bring you back to a more comfortable place emotionally.\n\nThe THOUGHT of studying for a math test might cause the emotions of dread or anxiety. You hate math. It's hard for you to understand, or maybe it's not and you just find it boring. What about reading that next chapter of a book? What about that work project you've been putting off at the peril of being fired? For whatever reason, you've associated negative emotions with those activities. Instead of regulating your emotions so that you can do the task, you give into them and avoid the task. \n\nTherefore, the key to beating procrastination is learning how to regulate those negative emotions. So how do you do that?\n\nYou remove the thought that whatever you need to do as difficult. It's not. Reading a chapter of a book isn't hard. You open the book, start reading, maybe underline some passages or take notes if it's academic in nature, and then close the book when you're done. Your mind has unreasonably built up that activity as a threat or something that will cause suffering to you. But reading a book is a very benign activity. Your mind is lying to you. How many times have you found something to be way easier once you've started than you had built up in your head? Even if it's what we'd label a \"difficult\" task - maybe the book has a lot of unfamiliar scientific terms you have to learn. So what? All you have to do is learn some new words. It's not that hard, yet our emotions make us believe a monster will be lurking in the shadows waiting to pounce if we start reading, or doing that math assignment, or start on that work project. It's irrational emotion controlling you.\n\nStart telling yourself that the things you need to do are not hard; in fact they're very easy. This thing you need to do is not a big deal at all. Downplay the difficulty (because it's likely not as difficult as you imagine), and convince yourself that doing this thing will be a breeze. Don't allow the emotion of resistance to enter the picture. You need to reframe how you think about your tasks/activities in a positive way, tell yourself they're easy to do, and the negative emotion you usually have towards them will stay away. In other words - cut off your emotions about a task before they take hold. Regulate them. You're an adult, and you have the capacity to do this. \n\nThis is what ADHD meds do - they work on the parts of the brain that regulate emotion, and make it easier for you to do things. We can also do this consciously without medication - you just have to be aware of it. Medication just does a lot of the work for you, but you can achieve the same thing by learning to regulate your emotions yourself. \n\nI have ADHD, and I realized that all of my procrastination was caused by a negative emotional response. That led to strong feelings of resistance, which made it extremely difficult to get things done. I was allowing myself to be controlled by my emotions instead of me controlling my emotions. All of the productivity tips in the world do nothing to help that, because they don't address the problem. \n\nSo next time you're faced with doing something you usually procrastinate on, focus on tamping down your negative emotions, tell yourself the task is easy to do and no big deal, and you'll find that resistance vanish.",

And often, starting is the hardest part.\n\nWhat about you? What are your tricks?",

I tracked every minute of focused work - real, high-effort tasks like writing reports, deep analysis, or complex problem solving. The result?

Everyone talks about them because they actually work. Doesn't matter which app you use. I set mine to block everything and you have to earn screen time throughout the day.

    "title": "I realized why I was perpetually fatigued/brain fogged despite being healthy",
    "selftext": "TL;DR:\nIf you constantly feel tired or brain fogged despite being healthy, it might not be physical - it could be your brain emotionally reacting to a life that feels meaningless or disconnected from your goals.\n\nSo I wanted to share something that’s been kind of a breakthrough for me lately. I’ve pretty much felt tired or foggy for as long as I can remember - since I was a teenager, really. And I’ve always lived a pretty healthy lifestyle, I’ve done all the checkups, bloodwork, sleep, supplements, diet, you name it - everything came out fine. Yet I always felt like my brain was operating under a thick blanket, like I was there but not really there.\n\nBut then I stumbled upon this video online that completely shifted how I look at it. Basically: tiredness can actually be an emotion. And emotions, even though they feel \"mental\", are physiological. They show up in your body. Like when you're anxious, and your stomach turns, or you get a migraine, or your muscles tighten. The same way, “tiredness” can actually be your body’s way of expressing something emotional - it’s like your system is saying, “I don’t want to be here. This isn’t meaningful. Let’s just shut down.”\n\nAnd that made me remember something from when I was younger. My parents used to send me to extracurricular sports training, and I absolutely hated it - it felt pointless to me. But I figured out that if I pretended to be asleep, they’d sometimes let me stay home. And I started noticing this pattern where I’d feel “tired” right when it was time to go. Almost like my body learned to feel tired as a way of protecting me from something it didn't want to do. And that’s when it clicked: maybe this never stopped.\n\nFast forward to recently - I went through a phase where I wasn’t super strict with sleep or food or anything, but I felt insanely energized and mentally sharper, even tireless at times. I was doing something that I truly believed was worthwhile for me and I could sleep less and feel more alive than ever. And it made me realize: maybe I wasn’t tired because of some health issue... maybe I was tired because life felt off, like I wasn’t spending time in ways that aligned with who I truly wanted to become. Or, I didn't think that spending my time doing this task would help me achieve my goal for whatever reason, and thus I perceived it to be meaningless.\n\nSo now, when I catch myself dragging through the day, I stop and ask: Does my brain subconsciously think this is a waste of time? Because if your goals and your daily life aren’t pointing in the same direction, your brain might just slam the brakes - fog you up - so you don’t waste energy on what it believes is pointless.\n\nFor example, maybe you’ve tried to build a business a bunch of times, failed, and now every time you sit down to try again, your brain subconsciously goes, \"what’s the point, I will pour all this effort and stress and still not achieve financial freedom\", and boom - instant fatigue. It’s like emotional self-preservation.\n\nThe way I deal with it now is pretty simple: I ask myself, How will I feel after doing this? If the answer is “proud,” that’s usually enough to override the fog and energize me. But if the answer is “the same or worse,” then maybe the task really doesn’t belong in my life, or I need to reframe it. I know this sounds to good to be true, but it works in my case.\n\nAnyway, just thought I’d share this in case someone else out there is wondering why they always feel tired even when everything on paper looks fine.",

I couldn’t remember the last time I let my mind rest.  \n\n- Waiting in line? *Scroll.*  \n- Riding the bus? *Scroll.*  \n- Even brushing my teeth? A video was always playing in the background.  \n\nIt hit me hard: I was terrified of boredom. Every time my brain had the chance to be quiet, I filled it with distractions. I was drowning out my own thoughts.  \n\n---\n\n**A Moment of Stillness**  \n\nOne day, my phone died on the way home from work. No music. No scrolling. Just me, sitting on the train, staring out the window. At first, it felt unbearable—like my mind was scrambling for something to latch onto.  \n\nBut then, something strange happened.  \n\nI started noticing little things. The way sunlight flickered through the windows. The soft murmur of conversations around me. Even the rhythm of the train became soothing.  \n\nAnd within that stillness, my mind began to wander.  \n\n---\n\n**What I Learned from Embracing Boredom**  \n\nThat one accidental moment of stillness changed me. I started leaning into boredom instead of running from it. Here’s what I found:  \n\n- **Creativity blooms in silence.** When I stopped filling every moment, I began having ideas I hadn’t thought about in years.  \n- **Clarity feels like peace.** Without constant distractions, I had time to process my emotions and make sense of my thoughts.  \n- **Life is full of beauty we miss.** On a walk without headphones, I noticed how the leaves danced in the wind and felt deeply connected to the world around me.  \n\n---\n\n**Stillness Is Where You Find Yourself**  \n\nWe live in a world that tells us to fill every moment with \"more.\" More scrolling, more noise, more productivity. But the irony is, the best parts of life come when we stop.  \n\nSo here’s my advice: the next time you feel bored, let it happen. Let the discomfort pass and see what’s waiting on the other side.  \n\nBoredom isn’t an emptiness t’s a doorway.  \n\nHave you ever embraced stillness?

    "selftext": "I know that getting up in the morning is often the hardest part of the day, and I was suffering from the same problem for 20 years. I wanted to share something that is helped me immensely.\n\nThe key is stimulating as many senses as possible. The human body has 5 main senses: Seeing, hearing, feeling, tasting, smelling\n\nMost people only rely on number 2, but by forcing your body to process a combination of multiple, it makes it a lot easier for your body to wake up. No 5-second rituals or anything conscious on your end - just your body realizing it's time to wake up.\n\nTo illustrate, this is my personal wake-up environment:\n\nMaterials: Sunrise alarm clock (Phillips), Smart Phillips Hue lights, Apple HomePods, Eight-sleep temperature controlled mattress, Apple watch / Whoop band\n\nI usually go to bed around 2-4am and wake up at 9:00am. Black-out curtains are all pulled, so it's pitch black.\n\nAt 8:30am, my sunrise alarm clock starts gradually getting brighter and my eight-sleep mattress starts getting colder (this is better than hotter, as it kick starts your body's metabolism to try to heat up). At 8:45am, my smart lights around my bed turn on to 50%. At 9:00am, my smart lights turn to 100%, my HomePods start playing soft Lofi music, my Apple Watch haptic alarm goes off, and my mattress turns quite cold.\n\nBy this point, my body has already been waking up gradually over the last half hour, and even if I was in deep/REM sleep, my body seems to get the signal. The continuous LoFi music makes it impossible to fall back asleep as my ears are continually processing things.\n\nSince I've started this, I've never had a morning where I was super groggy, even with suboptimal sleep.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\\---\n\nEdit 1: Some people are mentioning the difficulty of acquiring the rather pricey items that I use for my routine. These are just what I use, but they're by no means the only solution. You can definitely reap most of the rewards for a fraction of the cost.\n\nAs light brings the most benefit, start by searching up \"Amazon basics smart a19 led light bulb\". As others have mentioned, you can also use a time-controlled fan for temperature control (which may work even better as you can physically feel the wind). For sound, you can keep using your phone/alarm, but I would recommend music that plays alongside your morning routine instead of ending abruptly, as it's a more peaceful transition. In any case, focus on the themes, not the gadgets!\n\n\\---\n\nEdit 2: My personal thought process behind this setup:\n\nAfter trying out many different \"hacks\" for waking up (i.e. putting my phone alarm far from bed, making my bedroom uncomfortable, setting a timer, etc), I realized how I was just fighting my body every day and starting the day off on the wrong foot. I then thought back to all the times where I didn't get enough sleep but still was able to leave my bed fairly easily. Most of them followed a common theme - environmental stimulation &amp; chaos. By making my body subconsciously aware that the world around me is moving (through the 5 senses), I let it take care of waking itself up.\n\n\\---\n\nEdit 3: 7-8 hours of sleep is key, of course. Unfortunately, we all have our own schedules and sometimes things don't go to plan. This setup is just to make things easier when things don't always go your way (or if you're tired no matter how much you sleep, like me)",

However it’s also true that everyone is built differently at the chemical level and receive different rewards from different tasks and so comparison is ultimately worthless.",

    "title": "How I Managed to Do More (Without Adding More Hours to My Day)",
    "selftext": "\\*\\*\\*I posted this yesterday and sorry - I am new here. I added a link to the tool which I was not meant to do - and the post got removed. I was really taken back by how many people found the post useful so I am just going to leave this advise here. I am not sure how to get the tool to those who asked\\*\\*\\*\n\n\n\nAt the start of 2024, I genuinely thought I had my life under control.\n\nI was balancing a full-time job, studying math and computer science in my second year, overseeing the construction of a new house, and—most importantly—raising a three-year-old.\n\nIt was a lot, sure. But I had systems. I had routines. I told myself I was managing my time well.\n\nThen April hit. And everything collapsed.\n\nThe house was finally ready, and we had **three weeks** to move. At the same time, my job ramped up with multiple high-priority projects, and I checked my academic portal to find **ten** assessments due back-to-back.\n\nSuddenly, I felt like I was drowning.\n\nAnd unlike before, I couldn’t just “power through.” Why? Because I was a **parent.**\n\nThe work deadlines didn’t care if I was running on no sleep.  \nThe assignments didn’t pause just because I had a sick toddler who needed me at 3 AM.  \nThe house move wasn’t going to organize itself while I was chasing a three-year-old around the kitchen.\n\nAnd I told myself the same thing that every busy parent says:\n\n* *“I just don’t have time for this.”*\n* *“I’ll focus on what really matters later.”*\n* *“There’s nothing I can do—parenting takes up everything.”*\n\nAnd then one night, after another exhausting day where I got *nothing* done, I came across a quote from *168 Hours* by Laura Vanderkam:\n\n*\"Many of us have no idea; one of the benefits of claiming to be overworked or starved for time is that it lets you off the hook for dealing with the burden of choice.\"*\n\nThat hit me **hard.**\n\nBecause I realized I had no clue where my time was actually going.\n\nSo, out of desperation, I did a **Time Audit.**\n\nFor one week, I tracked every hour of my day. Every meeting, every task, every break. And what I found? **It wasn’t parenting that was taking all my time—it was everything else.**\n\nIt was:  \n📱 The “quick” social media breaks at work that turned into 45-minute scrolling sessions.  \n💬 The small talk that stretched into entire conversations.  \n📺 The mindless TV at night that left me exhausted but still convinced I needed it to “unwind.”\n\nI wasn’t **too busy**—I was just **spending my limited free time on the wrong things.**\n\nAnd as a parent, **free time is rare.**\n\nSo, I changed everything.\n\n* I started **scheduling my days with intention**—not just listing tasks, but actually **blocking time for them** (including time with my kid and downtime).\n* I set **boundaries** at work and cut out distractions that weren’t adding value.\n* I even started **scheduling rest**, so when I did relax, it was intentional—not just collapsing in front of the TV and calling it self-care.\n\nAnd within weeks?\n\n*  I stayed on top of work *and* landed a new role. \n*  I finished all my assignments and entered my final year.  \n* I had **more** time for my child, not less.  \n* And for the first time in months, I actually felt **present**—instead of just constantly racing against the clock.\n\nI learned that **it was never about time. It was about clarity.**\n\nWe all say we don’t have time. But in reality, we just don’t have visibility on where our time is going.\n\nSo if you feel like you’re always busy but getting nowhere, try a **Time Audit.**\n\nIt changed everything for me, and it might just do the same for you.\n\n**Edit** Hi guys! Overwhelmed with the responses and everyone asking for the tool. For those that I sent it to, I got banned for 3 days for spamming a link 🙈 so I just updated my bio wink wink. Will reply to all when I can and hopefully not get banned again!",

    "selftext": "If you’re a chronic procrastinator, I’ve got a strategy that might just work for you, the “(10+2)x5” method.\n\nThis anti-procrastination hack, created by Merlin Mann, is ridiculously simple. All you need is a timer and your to-do list.\n\n\t1.\tSet your timer for 10 minutes. For those 10 minutes, focus on your task with single-minded intensity. Like, seriously. It’s just 10 minutes—no “quick research,” no doom-scrolling. Just work.\n\t2.\tAfter the 10 minutes are up, set the timer for 2 minutes. This is your break. Do whatever you want—grab coffee, check Reddit, dance around your room. (I personally recommend walking or stretching to refresh your brain.) But here’s the catch: stick to 2 minutes—no more, no less.\n\t3.\tRepeat this work-play cycle five times. That’s the “x5” part. In total, you’ll work for an hour (50 minutes of work + 10 minutes of breaks).\n\nWhy does this work?\n\t•\tIt’s less intimidating. Knowing you only have to focus for 10 minutes makes starting way easier.\n\t•\tYou look forward to both work and breaks. The constant switch keeps things fresh and stops procrastination from taking over.\n\t•\tIt builds momentum. Once you get into the flow, you might even find yourself skipping the breaks and diving into more work.\n\nThe “(10+2)x5” method is perfect for overcoming that initial hurdle of just getting started. Plus, it’s adaptable: if you’re feeling ambitious, you can stack multiple cycles or extend your focus times.\n\nHave any of you tried something similar?",

    "title": "A Complete 3-Step Guide to Quit Any Bad Habit",
    "selftext": "I'm making this post to save you from wasting years of your life trying to quit, just like I did.  \n(I've posted this on other subreddits as well to help as many people as possible)\n\nBut first, let me give you a quick introduction- 2 and a half years ago, I decided to improve my life. With that I realized that I unfortunately had multiple addictions- **porn, phone addiction, junk food/sugar, video games, binging TV shows, etc.**\n\nNow, allow me to flex.\n\n* About 540 days ago, I watched porn for the last time in my life.\n* At the start of this year, my screen time went officially from 8 hours to 30 minutes.\n* I also decided to go sugar-free (added sugars) 8 months ago to test myself (and I'm still successful)\n\nAnd finally, I can confidently say that I have understood everything necessary to break free from bad habits/addictions. I barely even get any cravings anymore. Keep in mind it wasn't always like this- I went through the same struggles you face and made mistakes on my journey.\n\nI hope this helps as much as it would've helped me a couple of years ago, but anyways here's EVERYTHING I learnt after successfully breaking free from my addictions:\n\n**1- Gradual decrease &gt; Cold turkey**\n\nA while after I quit my porn addiction, I came across a video of a guy explaining that completely quitting all at once isn't going to work. It made sense. I started to reflect back and realized that with every streak I held, the amount of days I abstained kept increasing and increasing, up until I could stop for 30 days comfortably, at which point I quit for good.\n\nSo basically, I unknowingly used a gradual decrease, and it worked.\n\nIt makes sense- your brain wouldn't be used to having absolutely no dopamine spikes after being used to experiencing dopamine rushes for the past couple of years of your life.\n\nThen, I implemented this principle to quit my phone addiction and junk food.\n\nI do think I could have quit a lot quicker if I maintained a written plan and tracked my indulgences rather than having a rough idea. It might sound weird to 'schedule' your next relapse but instead think of it as achieving small goals of abstaining, that in the long run, will lead to you becoming free. I think a gradual decrease over a couple of months will work.\n\n**2- PURPOSE**\n\nPeople think that discipline is the most important thing when it comes to quitting, but it isn't. I realized that there was a technique that was much more effective than resisting cravings.\n\nAnd that is- getting rid of the craving in the first place.\n\nYes, it is possible to eliminate, or at least drastically reduce, the amount of urges you get.  \nHow do I know this? Because I've done it myself. I can't say for sure that I NEVER get cravings, but finding purpose in life has 100% worked for me.\n\nThink about why you want to live your life (hard question- I know haha) and be as ambitious as possible. For example, I want to become a successful entrepreneur who can change the lives of many people while becoming financially free.\n\nNow, you might think doing this is irrelevant, but please stick with me on this one.  \nHere's the thing; I was trying to quit my addictions, but I didn't know WHY I was trying.\n\nYour brain will not give up your addictions unless it realizes that there is are benefits that make it worth quitting. \"He who has a why can bare for almost any how\".  \nSo- think about your dreams in life, and ask yourself how quitting will benefit you.\n\nThis shifts the focus from you STRUGGLING to quit, to now BENEFITING from abstaining.  \nThis also boosts your discipline like crazy since it's a lot easier to view things logically.\n\nAlso, you will end up falling back into addiction if you have no clue what you are going to spend your time on. I replaced the time and energy by mainly pursuing entrepreneurship, along with other things like sports, working out, reading, sleeping more, so on and so forth.\n\nI suggest having one key passion to devote most of your time to, and then doing other healthy or enjoyable things on the side.\n\n**3- CUES AND RESPONSE**\n\nThis is by far the easiest part of the journey.  \nThe habit loop consists of 4 parts: Cue -&gt; Craving -&gt; Response -&gt; Reward  \n(Craving is sometimes omitted since it's closely linked to reward, but yeah)\n\nPurpose handles craving and reward, but now let's focus on what TRIGGERS you to start the ROUTINE of the habit.\n\nIn order to eliminate cues, which is once again stupidly simple, you need to CHANGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT. For example, I simply put my phone in a drawer instead of on the table, and boom- my triggers for my phone addiction fell by roughly 50%. All because my phone was out of sight.\n\nDon't believe me? What if I told you that 95% of American soldiers addicted to heroin during the Vietnam War were able to easily quit as soon as they came back home?\n\nSo- think about your cues- and find a way to remove them from your life. Be strict with this. Don't come up with excuses.\n\nAnd finally, to reduce your response to bad habits, INCREASE FRICTION. This is basically adding more steps to complete before indulging in your addiction. The idea behind this is that when your brain realizes that effort is needed to do something, it puts it off and procrastinates. And yes- this applies to the things we want to quit as well.\n\nAs soon as I read about this from Atomic Habits- I implemented it and understood that the human brain is pretty simple. And silly.\n\nSo just make your bad habit harder to do. For example, I kept the controller to my gaming console in another room, and deleted the apps on my phone. The added effort and time needed to indulge now made my brain crave these things less. TRY THIS FOR YOURSELF, PLEASE.\n\nAlright, I spent about half an hour writing everything above, and I really do hope it helps.\n\nMy DMs are open if you need anything else. TAKE ACTION, and all the best ahead :)",
