    "title": "What I learned designing a TV mount that installs in 5 minutes with just nails",
    "selftext": "One of the more interesting projects we worked on at ProductInnov was with a client who had this bold idea: make a TV mount you can install on drywall in minutes, without drills, studs, or power tools.\n\nAt first, we were not sure it was possible. Traditional mounts need screws and anchors. But the concept was to rely on nails at an angle so the weight would distribute across the wall. We ran a lot of simulations and tested prototypes until we landed on a design that could hold TVs over 100 pounds securely.\n\nThe end result was Hangsmart TV, a bracket you can hang up in under 5 minutes. We tested it, refined it, and eventually it ended up on shelves at Walmart, Home Depot, and Amazon. Reviews from renters and DIYers were huge because it meant no more damaging walls or hiring installers.\n\nWhat I liked most about this project was that it shows how an idea that sounds impossible can work if you engineer it the right way. Sometimes the real innovation is not inventing something totally new, but rethinking how existing problems are solved.\n\nCurious to hear from others, what is a product you once thought was too simple to innovate but turned out to be a game changer once someone improved it?\n\n",
