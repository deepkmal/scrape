It is all custom made by me, but I’ve never made a desk or cabinets before so it was quite the learning experience. The speakers are standard Kanto YU2 with custom stands I made. \n\nEven if this desk/build only inspires one person to “go for their idea” I’d be so happy!! This is a true testament that you can make your dream a reality with enough work and a clear vision! \n\nAnyways hope you like! \n\nIf you have any questions I’ll do my best. ",

    "selftext": "Have a little Sunday morning picture dump of the setup!\n\nMost important changes are changing from my Windows gaming PC to the Mac Mini that was on my secondary setup, and switching out the Ikea Alefjall chair for the Autonomous ErgoChair Pro. The Windows PC (still visible in the back corner, next to the Ikea Alex drawers) is connected to the LG 42\" OLED tv on the right, so I can still play my games when I want. I have a little Ikea Fjallbo laptop table I put in front of the tv for mouse and keyboard.\n\nThe main desk is now for browsing, media consumption and editing. Things I just prefer doing on MacOS nowadays, hence the switch. Next big change will probably be the revised Apple Studio Display in 2026. I'll miss the 34\" ultrawide, but it has served me well in the past 5 years.  \nAny questions? Hit me up in the comments!\n\n(better quality photos: [https://imgur.com/a/apgGb2h](https://imgur.com/a/apgGb2h), since these uploads appear to be very blurry...)",

    "selftext": "I'm sharing an overview of my office, where I spend most of my days. I'm a freelance graphic designer, so I work there a lot... and I also play games there quite a bit when I have a moment.\n\nThe latest addition to my setup is a new chair. I used to have an IKEA JÄRVFJÄLLET, which I liked, but it wasn't ideal for sitting for long periods of time. I took advantage of a promotion to get an Autonomous ErgoChair Pro, and honestly, I can feel the difference: everything is adjustable, which helps a lot with my back problems, and I'm less \"broken\" at the end of the day.  \nThe armrests are a nice surprise too. I never used them before, but now they fit in well and are really practical. I don't use them much for work (I'm often leaning towards my graphics tablet), but for playing on the console, they're perfect: a more relaxed position, the controller on my lap, the screen slightly tilted... and I can stay at my desk without any problems, even after a long day.  \nAs for the rest of the setup: lots of green plants, Mac Mini M4, LG 32UD89-W monitor, XP-Pen Deco Pro tablet, iPad Air, Logitech keyboard/mouse, Switch OLED, Xbox Series X, Analogue Pocket... and for sound, a small Bose speaker and Sony headphones for music.\n\nI try to keep the space simple and pleasant. Nothing spectacular, but a corner where I feel comfortable, whether I'm working or starting a gaming session.",

    "selftext": "I have finally found stands for my speakers in white that weren’t too expansive. Since I won't be changing this setup anymore, I drilled holes in the table and the stands so that I don't see any cables. \nThe tabletop is from the DIY store and wasn't very expensive. I can easily change it if necessary. Maybe I'll build the remaining cables into the monitor arm... i have to check ob that 😆\n\nThe speakers are Edifier M60 with Kanto SP9 stands. For my mobile phone holder, I currently use an extendable frame (3D printed) with an original Magsafe V2 with a 30W charger. I only had transparent teal filament at home, hence the colour. I might swap it now for white.…. But somehow I like it this way. ☺️\n\nMy work PC is a Surface Pro 7, which is attached to the back of the monitor in a homemade holder. For personal use, I use the M4 Mac Mini, which is mounted under the table. Of course, the usual Logi Keys / MX Master set is a must (although I'm considering swapping it for the white ones 😅). \n\nThe table frame is from Flexispot and is height-adjustable. I use the Markus chair from Ikea. At the back, there is a Philipps hue strip in a U-profile with a diffuser. The monitor is the LG 27U500W on an inexpensive monitor arm from Amazon. \n\n\nWhat do you think? Do i miss something? \n",

The main monitor is a 34” ultra wide and I think the vertical monitor is 27”. \n\nGot the Flexispot E7 standing desk legs and topped that with a 60x30 beech butcher block from Floor and Decor. A little DIY sanding, slight white wash, and seal and she was good to go!\n\nThought a standing desk with a walking pad would be a fun way to lose some extra baby weight from having three boys in three years. 😅\n\nI want to get some Govee light strips to light up behind the desk and one of those sweet table lamps they offer with the fun colors but for now this is my after hours oasis when the kids go to bed!🥰\n\nStill playing World of Warcraft after 20 years. 🫣Maybe I’ll find something else soon! \n\nAny recommendations on changes, questions, or even games are welcomed. I do wish I would have gotten a cable vertebrae instead of the mesh cord cover for under the desk but I went for a budget option.\n\nI’m loving this setup so much!Thanks for stopping by!",
