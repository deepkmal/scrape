    "title": "Best CRM for real estate agents? According to Reddit",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone! I recently got my real estate license in the last couple of years and my client list is starting to grow (finally!). I’ve realized that juggling spreadsheets, email reminders, and notes on my phone is a total nightmare. It’s definitely time for a proper CRM.\n\nThe problem is, I see a million different suggestions out there. Some CRMs say they’re “built exclusively for real estate agents,” while others are more general but still claim to integrate with popular property-listing tools. I’d love to hear from people who’ve actually used them especially if you’re an active agent.\n\n**Main Features I Need:** Automated follow-ups, pipeline management (so I can track leads from first contact to closing), and maybe some email marketing capabilities.\n\n**Ease of Use:** I’m tech savvy but also short on time, so a user friendly interface is key.\n\n**Integration:** Something that pairs nicely with my existing tools (like Zillow, Realtor.com or Google Calendar).\n\n**Pricing:** I don’t mind a monthly fee if it genuinely helps me close more deals, but hidden add-ons drive me nuts.\n\nSo, if you’re an agent who’s tried a few different platforms, I’d love to know which one felt like the best real estate CRM in your experience. Any hidden gems, or maybe popular ones that turned out to be a letdown?\n\nThanks in advance for any input! I’d really appreciate hearing how you manage your leads and stay on top of everything.",

(Context: I'm a developer, running our IT service business.)\n\nWhen running your own solution:  \n\\- you can host all data where you want, in the cloud, on-premises etc  \n\\- you pay no licencing cost per user, only for infra and maintenance  \n\\- marketing material says \"with salesforce there's no maintenance overhead\" - wtf of course, you even need EXTRA \"salesforce developers\" who knows nothing of code and just can click fields in SF  \n\\- if you set up proper encryption and backup it's as secure as SF  \n\\- you can build your software around the problem, not the problem around the software  \n\\- you can integrate with other services just like SF does, I mean, it's only API calls after all\n\n  \nI would understand that Salesforce makes sense if it was cheap. 10$ per user of something.

    "selftext": "Hi, I’m Alex, CTO and co-founder of Attio.\n\nWe started building Attio out of a belief that CRM tools could be better than the clunky tools that came before. As a startup founder before Attio, I saw first hand how much CRMs blocked teams from doing effective work and growing their business.\n\nHere's where I think CRM is headed (and where it needs to go):\n\n**1 - GTM operators are builders now.**\n\nToday's GTM teams think like engineers. They architect workflows, stitch APIs together, and wire up complex logic. The tools they have today were built for a different era, where tooling either existed in an opinionated vacuum or provided flexibility at the cost of insanely high complexity.\n\nI believe that GTM operators have long been blocked by sub-standard tooling and that they deserve software that’s as flexible and ambitious as their ideas.\n\n**2 - CRM should be built around the people using it, not just the people reporting from it.**\n\nLegacy CRMs were designed for sales managers to track their team. This meant that the people actually using it every day (AEs, SDRs, CS teams, founders) are stuck with clunky interfaces built for someone else.\n\nCRMs should be built around the person doing the work, not just the person managing it.\n\n**3 - Most CRMs aren't ready for AI.**\n\nLLMs are a once-in-a-generation shift in how we think about software.\n\nWe've been focused on rethinking CRM around what we call AI primitives. Building blocks that let AI truly perform, not just sit on top of existing data models.\n\nOne example of this is our new App SDK. It lets anyone build custom apps directly into the Attio platform. We designed it with first class support for AI assisted code generation from day one. It uses React, running in a totally custom secure runtime that makes AI code safe to run without compromising on security.\n\nWe also offer built-in CLAUDE and AGENTS markdown files, alongside an MCP server for easy access to documentation - so vibe-coders can flow freely.\n\nThe goal is to make CRM feel like clay, not concrete. I’m so impressed with what people have already built with it and I’m really excited to see how GTM builders use it to radically change what they expect from a CRM.\n\nI’d love to know what would you change about CRM? I'll be here to discuss any ideas and answer questions.\n\n*\\[EDIT: The AMA is now finished. Thank you for all the questions!\\]*",

That’s just a taste of Kool-Aid before they shove the IV drip in and start billing you $1,200 a month for the privilege of hitting your own email limits. Every feature you need is locked behind paywalls like some twisted MMORPG designed by corporate sadists.\n\nNeed support? Good luck. You’ll spend hours in a Kafkaesque chat purgatory with a \"customer happiness agent\" who responds every 12 minutes with canned copy-paste nonsense like, “Have you tried clearing your cache?” Meanwhile your funnel’s on fire and your sales team has regressed to Google Sheets out of sheer despair.\n\nIntegrations? Clunky. Reporting? Primitive unless you shell out for add-ons. Want to cancel? That’s the true horror. It’s like trying to leave a cult. You’ll discover terms you never agreed to, loopholes they slither through, and invoices that mysteriously keep coming like a cursed fax machine in a haunted office.\n\nHubSpot doesn’t help you scale.

We use Click Up for project management, but it's CRM doesn't seem to work well for us. \n\nWhat we need: \n- all leads to be in one place from gmail, google sheets, website, chat threads (ideally it can pull updates from gmail once connected) \n- ability to send emails and track responses, reminders for follow-ups \n- some kind of performance metrics to see which communication worked better \n - help with finding leads (but not sure how CRMs can do that if we are in a niche business of providing data solutions to mission-driven orgs) \n\nAll to say, which CRM can help us at this time? It seems like we need something more efficient than pulling update on Google sheets all the time but not sure what this can be! \n\nThank you for helping! Here to learn and open for all advice. ",

Honest replies with insight and a link will be approved, but most 'link drops' will not. We want this to be a subreddit for discussion, not a sales pool.\t\n\t\n**Posting: Search before posting**\n\nDo at least one search before posting, chances are someone's had a similar question. If you can't find anything, see next rules, then post :)\n\n**Posting: Give deep context**\n\nDo you need CRM advice? Share your team size, industry, leads/day, platforms you need it to connect to, budget, and what you're currently using; lastly note what you don't want. The more detail you give (even if you don't know the right words to use), the more likely someone here will be able to help you.\n\nShort or vague asks may be removed (as they lead to torrents of link/name spam). If this happens, please do post again with more context.\n\n**No Spam**\n\nSeek first to actually write a good post or comment, then add links if applicable. If your whole post or comment seems to be designed to get visitors to your link it will be removed.\n\n**No quick pitches**\n\nDon’t see anyone asking which CRM and just name drop or link drop. Give actual feedback or useful information. Statements such as ‘give x crm a try, I can demo it’ will be removed.\n\t\n**CRM Megathread**\n\nWe are working on a CRM Megathread. Watch this space.\n\t\n**Be kind**\n\nThis shouldn't need saying, but this community will have all levels of entrepreneurs and CRM users, any comments not in the general tone of helpfulness will be removed.\t\n\t\n**We are not support**\n\nIf this is a problem with a specific CRM, first try looking on the CRM providers knowledge base and reaching out to their support. If you've tried that and are just looking for other power users, write that in the preface to your post (it's useful to share where CRMs are lacking and they refuse to add/fix features). Someone might help here, but if it's an obvious support request the post may be removed.\n\n\n... that being said if there's something useful you've learned in using any CRM, share it, it might help other /r/CRM users.",

We want a standard kanban with a card for each sale, and when we click on that card we want to read all our correspondence pertaining to that sale. It needs to work, and if we're paying money for it then it needs to work well.\n\nTo us, this seems like CRM at its most simple. We don't need AI tools to write emails, we don't need the complex reminder systems and automated outreach facilities we keep getting offered. What we want is a way to visualise the vast number of incoming and outgoing emails we're currently dealing with. \n\nEvery time we get close, there's a problem. It prioritises individuals rather than sales prospects in the database, meaning emails are even messier than they are in folders. It works, but only with Outlook or Gmail. It might work, but it's hideously expensive, largely because it's bloated with stuff we don't need.\n\nIt seems like everybody is doing a CRM. There are more CRMs than ever before. I guess what we think of as \"simple\" might actually be super niche and only apply to our use case. And maybe our idea of a good price (like $20 a month, maybe $50) is actually low. But we don't have the time that it's taking to keep trying these solutions out and being disappointed, or finding out halfway through setup that there is some huge flaw that negates all the effort. \n\nI don't understand why this is sucking so much!

Are conversion rates going up? Are we finding better-fit prospects? Are campaigns improving because of AI, or just faster because of it? Those are the things I’m trying to isolate.  \n  \nCurrently using Clay (for about a month) with a few analytics layers to see if the AI side is actually improving lead quality and campaign precision. The idea is that if enrichment and filtering are done better, conversion should naturally go up and wasted spend should drop. It feels like it’s working because engagement quality has improved, but I still don’t have a clear way to measure it financially (is there a way??).  \nAnyone using AI in your marketing stack, how are you measuring the real ROI? Are you tracking hard metrics like cost per qualified lead or revenue lift, or more soft indicators like improved targeting and faster turnaround?  \n  \nWould love to hear how other people are defining success with AI tools beyond just efficiency.

Right from the beginning, I faced a growing set of perplexing issues that have now combined into an overpowering feeling of discontentment with their service. Let me shed light on the many factors contributing to my deep dissatisfaction:  \n\n\n1. \\*\\*Subpar Customer Support\\*\\*: The issue persists with Freshdesk's customer support, which paradoxically mirrors the mediocre service they aim to enhance. When we sought help for technical problems, the responses were like off-key tunes – slow, unclear, and rarely leading to the resolution we expected. It felt as if their support team wasn't really tuned into our concerns.\n\n2. \\*\\*Ineffective Ticket Management\\*\\*: Freshdesk's highly-touted ticket management system has brought about a confusing mess, like a composition with conflicting melodies. Organizing and prioritizing tickets became a chaotic task, and the promised workflow automation features ended up causing more confusion than order.\n\n3. \\*\\*Annoying Ring Tone that Can't Be Changed\\*\\*: Adding to the disharmony, the Freshdesk phone system's consistently annoying ring tone disrupts the overall experience. This auditory annoyance is like an out-of-tune instrument that just won't find its pitch, taking away from an otherwise smooth experience.\n\n4. \\*\\*Declined Refund Requests\\*\\*: Another issue arises when we consider Freshdesk's refusal to provide refunds for their annual plans. This unwavering stance contradicts the idea of customer satisfaction and shows a lack of concern for the various problems faced by their users.\n\n5. \\*\\*Steep Learning Curve\\*\\*: Navigating Freshdesk's user interface has been a complex process that requires a lot of practice to master. The intricate layout and unintuitive features create a challenging experience that leaves users struggling to find the right rhythm.\n\n6. \\*\\*Expensive and Disappointing\\*\\*: Given the numerous issues I've encountered, the price we paid for Freshdesk's services feels out of sync with the value we got. The consistent technical problems, lackluster support, unchangeable annoying ringtone, and refusal to provide refunds for annual plans create a noticeable imbalance between cost and benefit.\n\nIn the bigger picture of letdowns, Freshdesk's lack of harmony has reached new levels. I strongly advise anyone considering their services to pay attention to the problematic aspects highlighted above and explore other options that can offer a smoother experience. The disruptive elements of their unreliability, below-par support, complicated operations, bothersome ringtone, and rigid refund policy form a collection that falls short of delivering the promised harmony and customer satisfaction.",

Because I stress again, we’re not a super techy team. And what’s the deal with their pricing? I dont wanna forward something with really convoluted pricing, my boss would never let me hear the end of it. He’s willing to pay for quality, but shady pricing like with random charges popping up wont go down well. \n\nWe’ve looked at cheaper options like Wati⁤, Kommo⁤, and 360Dia⁤log, but they all face some form of issue I’ve described earlier. Lacking reliability, not easy to pick up, shady pricing models, one or the other. I’m assuming Respond wont have the same issues given the higher price tag, just need some reviews to know if it warrants that tag.\n\nHappy Holidays and Merry upcoming Christmas",

We do have Mailchimp set up already, and we’d be open to integrating it with a CRM that doesn’t handle email - but only if the integration is smooth and we don’t risk losing contacts between the two platforms.\n\nI’ve been searching for a few days and haven’t found anything under $1K that hits all these points.

    "title": "Why are we misunderstanding CRM softwares",
    "selftext": "Background:\nBeing in a formal CRM career with a product startup, it's been a 7th year for me to work with a lot of clients and even got to understand the competitive products like Salesforce, Zoho, SuiteCRM in great details. I had to wear multiple hats ranging from BA to guy installing CRM to customer advocate for large FinTech company to demoing advanced martech for indian PSUs and BFSI sector. \n\nI have been lurking in this sub and all I can see is the bulk of guys using advanced CRM softwares like a data entry software, without leveraging any \"CRM as a Tech\". Since there isn't seem to be much awareness on such advanced capabilities, I want to provide a clarification on CRM as a technology through few points and use cases. \n\n1. Mainly CRM as a process started with Technology. So it's not something that can be used like excel, rather it's been a progression of at least 20 years tech development. Think like CRMs as your mate who can track your customers on it's own, who can prioritise them or even serve them dynamic content as per their needs. It can tell you exactly who visited you as anonymous first timer and how it got converted to a very minute detail. If you are not using this, then it's not a CRM but simply an excel with better UI and more clicks. \n\n2. CRMs offers configurablility, so that you can define a use case and then execute it in automation or with manual intervention. I presented 150+ demonstrations on sales, support, marketing. All I had to do was asking the client his business process of sales/marketing and configuring it in the software using workflows, usually within few hours. If you are using a CRM that lacks configurablility or that's not configured correctly, then it's not gonna help you at all to grow.\n\n3. CRM offers a technical way to manage your customers interactions. But over the years, it grew well into designing it's own, effective business process. E.g. It offers leads and opportunities as separate modules, with separate criteria to clearly define your prospect. Lead modules focusing on how contact is entered in your digital universe vs opportunity is about how you treated it to be your customer. Such model is configured by default using components and even within their own purview, each components has 100 features to utilise for better customer understanding. \n\n4. CRM is no way gonna replace your existing sales folks, so rather use it to be helpful for them. A lot of asks on the sub didn't show this element. You can well try to ask a sales time optimiser that would help your sales person to prioritise his appointments or may be a workflow to help him creates tasks for him automatically. Otherwise all requirements are usually from the CEOs who have no idea about workplace struggles of sales people, and thus sales team tends to ignore the CRMs or using only to fill junk data coz their boss asked them for entries. \n\n\nWhole intent of this post is to suggest that there is actually a methodology &amp; technology offered by CRM. It's open to offer unlimited growth only in exchange of our better understanding of what CRM means. ",

We're a Pre Seed B2B SaaS and we've been using a Notion sheet but its quite hard to keep up with it (add notes, fill in all the fields etc.). Main contenders at the moment are Clarify and Attio. Any thoughts on them? Or a different CRM we're missing out on? \n\n  \nEDIT: I see a lot of people vouching for Hubspot - I've used it before but it felt quite admin heavy at the time - Has that changed?  \nAt the stage we're at I'm looking for something that asks for as little effort from the team as possible to stay somewhat maintained",

    "selftext": "Hey ya'll. I have been doing research trying to find a CRM that isn't made for a sale funnel or a small business but for an everyday person trying to remember details on the people he meets and probably won't see for a while. Here's an example. I go to an event and meet a few people. We don't do business cards or even phone numbers but I want to remember their names. I'd like to find a CRM where I can put their name, specific notes about them (every CRM has this), but also searchable tags. I need to have the ability to put down keyword tags so that when I meet them again, be it in a few days or months from now, I can search that keyword that I entered. Many times I remember details about the person like what business they are in or what state they are from, but can't remember their name. In that case I'd search the tag and have a lot less people to filter through. Does this exist at all? Or can this be made on excel? Thanks in advance!",

I'm a one-man team, so I don't need to use the crm system for management functions. Since I have never worked with CRM before, I would like to hear your experiences and recommendations. Here is what I need:  \nUser Friendly: Being new to CRM, I am looking for a system that is easy to use and has an intuitive interface.  \nData Collection and Management: I need a CRM that will allow me to store and manage customer data, including their responses from online questionnaires, orders and contacts. Subsequently, I would like to divide the data from the test into different groups. For example, women under 50 who have a problem with energy and drink little water.  \nAnalysis and Reporting: CRM should provide tools to analyze data and generate reports so that I can track the effectiveness of my marketing and sales strategies.  \nIntegration with Other Tools: I need a CRM that can be easily integrated with other platforms, such as e-shop systems, email marketing and possibly analytics tools.  \nBudget: As a startup I am looking for an affordable solution that is suitable for a small business.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",
