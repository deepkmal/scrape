Canada is implementing our $1.3 billion border plan — reinforcing the border with new choppers, technology and personnel, enhanced coordination with our American partners, and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl. Nearly 10,000 frontline personnel are and will be working on protecting the border.\n \nIn addition, Canada is making new commitments to appoint a Fentanyl Czar, we will list cartels as terrorists, ensure 24/7 eyes on the border, launch a Canada- U.S. Joint Strike Force to combat organized crime, fentanyl and money laundering. I have also signed a new intelligence directive on organized crime and fentanyl and we will be backing it with $200 million.\n \nProposed tariffs will be paused for at least 30 days while we work together.”\n\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-speak-trade-war-1.7448805[https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-speak-trade-war-1.7448805](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-trump-speak-trade-war-1.7448805)",

That way the economic fallout is avoided, but Trump gets to claim a \"win\" (i.e. on the border or something)?\n\nThe markets and the CAD would likely jump if that ends up being the result.\n\nStory: [https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2025/02/02/live-updates-us-booze-bans-pick-up-mexico-to-hit-back-americans-could-feel-some-pain-says-trump/](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2025/02/02/live-updates-us-booze-bans-pick-up-mexico-to-hit-back-americans-could-feel-some-pain-says-trump/)",

    "selftext": "https://globalnews.ca/news/10675060/air-canada-tgv-train-company-bidder-electric-fast-rail-project/\n\nAir Canada, which usually flies people around in planes, has decided to join a team that’s bidding to build a fast, high-frequency train system between Windsor and Quebec City. This is surprising because Air Canada has historically been against high-speed rail projects, especially in areas where they already have lots of flight routes.\n\nThey’re teaming up with SNCF Voyageurs, the French company that runs the famous TGV trains. While SNCF joining makes sense because they’re train experts, people are raising eyebrows about Air Canada’s involvement. Critics think Air Canada might be trying to control the rail project to protect its own business, especially since a fast train could take away some of their passengers.\n",
