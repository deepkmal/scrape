    "title": "What I have Learned From Spending Over $20M In Facebook Ad Spend Since 2018",
    "selftext": "Good day Redditors.\n\nI have written posts about how we approach advertising to drive success for our clients and our brands.\n\nThis post will be about a summary of learnings from spending over $20M in ad spend.\n\nI know it's not that much ad spend, there are people who manage this a month.\n\nTo be quite fair, 60% of the ad spending has come from this year.\n\nSo, let's start.\n\nI remember the early days of advertising in Meta. Back in 2018 literally anyone who had a somewhat decent product where able to generate sales.\n\nWhat was even more fun was that It was done with quite a few ads.\n\nThen all of the advertising was about \"hacking the ads manager\"\n\n* Testing interests\n* Creating lookalikes from followers, website visitors, purchases, email lists etc.\n\nBack in 2018, we were able to scale a bike company brand from $20k a month to $240k a month in just 10 months.\n\nWe found one ad, and we tried to spend as much money as possible with that ad doing all sorts of \"hacking ads manager\" stuff.\n\nThis was the year when we decided to launch sales on Halloween and generated $100k in just a few days.\n\nOur black friday that year didn't even come close.\n\nFast forward to 2020.\n\nThis was still before IOS, I noticed that it was tough to replicate the scaling with just one ad.\n\nIn 2020 we started to test new ads every month, I remember this vividly.\n\nCreated 3 ads for that month that we wanted to test, and we hit two winners.\n\nOne video, one image.\n\nWow... So that became our benchmark, test 2 new ads every month and still do \"hacking the ads manager\" trying to push these ads via interests, lookalikes, and duplicating campaigns from abo to CBO, to CBO from abo.\n\nThat time literally, our team spent at least 2 hours per day in Facebook ads manager trying to figure out the newest targeting hacks by using stacking.\n\nWe played around with interests stacks and lookalikes stacks.\n\nEven combo stacks. We really thought that this is what generates the best results.\n\nThen....\n\nArmageddon happened.\n\nIOS 14 Mother\\*\\*\\*er.\n\nThis update wiped our performance across all accounts like no other.\n\nWe thought that this was the extinction of Facebook ads.\n\nEveryone was screaming Facebook ads are dead.\n\nClients were dropping us left and right.\n\nThen after a month of horrible performance and losing clients, we still had to pay our people.\n\nWe understand that \"Hacking Facebook ads manager\" days have come to an end.\n\nWe started to test fewer interests but still kept the lookalikes. :D\n\nThis was the time when we started to test more ads - 4 a month.\n\nYes, we doubled the testing. It's actually funny to look back, thinking that testing 4 ads a month was actual testing.\n\nWe are at the end of 2021.\n\nTesting about 8 new ads every month for our brand and our clients.\n\nMainly using a stack of interests and a stack of lookalikes.\n\nNow it's January 2022, we signed this one client with the capacity to create ads and we were also building our in-house content department in order to scale creative testing.\n\nWe analyzed:\n\n* Facebook and Instagram content - what type of content are we seeing daily?\n\nTurns out we were seeing content that we were interested in.\n\n* Facebook and Instagram ads - again, most of the ads that were shown to us and that we reacted to were the stuff that we were interested in.\n\nInteresting...\n\nThis is still January 2022.\n\nWhat if we start researching customer psychology and customer behavior and just understand what type of content our target customer likes to see? ( I Have a post on how we approach research, so I won't describe this in detail in this post)\n\nLet's create ads that speak to our target customers by introducing awareness stages\n\n* Unaware ads - ads that take an unaware audience to most aware audience.\n* Problem-aware - ads that talk to people who know about their problem.\n* Solution-aware ads - ads that target people who understand that they have a problem but don't know which solution to choose.\n* Product aware - ads that target people who understand their problem and also know how that is the way on how to solve their problem but don't know which brand/product to choose.\n* Most aware - people who already know everything about their problem, how to solve it, what product to choose, they are just waiting for the right time to buy from you.\n\nSo how can we test the content?\n\nOne thing is creating the ads another is testing it.\n\nWe had this complicated ad account structure, one campaign ABO campaign to test audiences, and one CBO for scaling the best audiences with the best ads.\n\nWe aimed to create 20 ads.\n\nThere was no way we could test 20 ads and interests on the ABO level, this was like lighting money on fire.\n\nThen we decided to use\n\nOne CBO campaign.\n\nUse best-performing interests and lookalike combo stack and one broad ad set ( no targeting)\n\nTo test how the ads messages work.\n\nWhy no targeting?\n\nWell, by doing content analysis, we were interested in testing the theory of is the algorithm capable of delivering our ads to the right customer without us doing the targeting side.\n\nWe launched 3 video ads that were talking about the customer problem and educating how this product will solve it.\n\nOn day one, we are getting sales with interest and the lookalike combo stack is winning.\n\nDay two combo stack still winning by a lot.\n\nOn day three, our broad ad set was picking up more and more sales.\n\nDay four, our broad ad set, took 80% of that day's spend, leaving the combo stack in the dust.\n\nDay 5, our combo stack dot us one sale.\n\nDay 6, we turned off our combo stack and started creating new broad ad sets with new ad tests.\n\nIt took off.\n\nWe immediately did this for all of our accounts.\n\nSame result.\n\nImagine spending 4 years \"hacking the ads manager\" and seeing that no targeting is producing better results for niche markets than targeting.\n\nSince January 2022, we have been spending more and more time researching and developing the ads than the actual Facebook ad account.\n\nWe have measured that, on average, we spend up to 10 minutes a day optimizing the accounts, and 2-3 hours are spent on research and analyzing the data to create a better ad.\n\nOne of our first steps is to test 50-100 ads in the first month to understand what messaging hits.\n\nBy doing this, we are able to find winning messages really fast.\n\nWhat previously took 6-12 months now can be done in 1-3 months.\n\nTesting a lot of ad messages provides you with a lot of winners.\n\nThen creating at least 10 variations on winning ads, you can come down to 1-3 messages that spend 60-80% of your daily budget, which you can comfortably scale.\n\nToday.\n\nIf you say that ad testing does not work. You clearly haven't spent enough time researching and testing multiple ad variations.\n\nThe algorithm has become more and more content-oriented.\n\nThis is the reason we are not experiencing shit days with meta like most of brands and advertisers do.\n\nYes, we have a few a month, but it's nowhere near the amount that I read on this Reddit channel.\n\nSo, to sum up what it takes to generate good results with Facebook ads.\n\n1. Daily research 1-3 hours.\n2. Daily ad creation 1-2 hours.\n3. Daily ad optimization of 5-10 minutes.\n4. Ads is the targeting.\n5. Understanding your customers is by far the most important thing in order to create ads that they will react to.\n6. Content is king - that's why it's important to input hours and hours into content creation.\n\nFacebook is not rewarding mediocre input anymore.\n\nTop brands are still scaling.\n\nYou can do this too.\n\nKeep in mind this is just about Facebook ads, I'm not talking about what happens after the click, your website, your business numbers, upsells, crossells, email flows.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n**Updated post 11.10.2023**\n\nSometimes I like to think about Facebook ads as salespeople.\n\nWe know that big businesses have whole sales departments generating sales every minute.\n\nIf you only rely on one salesperson, it's going to get burnt our calling the phone 24/7.\n\nThe same thought process can be applied to meta.\n\nThe more salespeople you have out here calling the phone, and knocking on doors, the more sales you are going to get.\n\nFind the right salespeople.",

    "selftext": "Last February everything that I knew about facebook ads completely changed..\n\nIt was the biggest under the radar change on facebook's side i've ever seen.\n\nThe inconsistency drove me mad..\n\nAs someone who's ran ads for over 7 years I've never seen that scale of inconsistency since the facebook analytica scandal.  \n\nBecause of this I decided to test something new. \n\nBefore this process I'd have 5 campaigns with over performance than 1-2 would tank the results. And this would happen every single day.\n\nSo I decided to test an all in one testing and scaling structure and it absolutely crushed my expectations. \n\nHere’s a quick 5-10 minute read on how to run your facebook ads. \n\n\nThis is the only account structure you need to know for this year to get more leads, sales and appointments:\n|Prospecting|ASC remarketing|Scale| \n\nExclude all web visitors from Prospecting and Scale campaigns. And exclude all purchases from the ASC/manual remarketing campaign. Start all with Campaign level budget not ad set level budget. \n\nStart the prospecting campaign with a $30 a day budget. Depending on your remarketing pool for the holidays. This is your ROAS generator..\n\nFor the prospecting campaign add 5-8 creatives every single week. \n\n(We do this with a creative process called “Remixing the ad” i'll touch on that point in a bit)\n\nWith this structure the ads have to compete against each other. \n\nSo winners are competing with the new ads. \n\nSome new ads rise quickly, others don't even spend. \n\n(Facebook only spends when it feels it can achieve your goal, Don't force anything just let them run and keep adding creatives.)\n\nFor the remarketing campaign add 2-3 body copies and headlines every week to test copy. \n\nGo Manual targeting full broad no targeting with the Prospecting campaign and the Scale Campaign.\n\nWhen we have 3-4 winning creatives and Body/Headlines with spend and ROAS. \n\nWe then graduate those to a “Scale campaign” and set it immediately to $100 - $200 a day.\n\nYou can definitely scale more aggressively with a bid caps type of strategy and go straight to $500-$1,000 after this step. \n\nBut I recommend being more conservative if you have no experience running ads.\n\n(Also keep increasing your Remarketing campaigns. I recommend 20% of the daily ad budget.)\n\nHow to scale Facebook ads with manual bidding. \n\nHow I consistently scale to $1,000-$5,000 daily. \n\nThere’s 3 parts on the technical side to using manual: bid, structure, and budget. \n\nLet’s start with structure select: \n\n|Manual campaign| Bid Cap|Put spending on accelerated it’s right below your bidding strategy | add the winning ad sets| \n\nFor the bid make it $5-$20 lower than account average at first to see if you get volume. \n\nExample your account average for a lead or sale is $35 put the bid at $25\n\nWait 24 hours if no volume increase bid by $5-$10. This is a feel for the auction ex. $30 doesn’t get volume.. put it on $40 and the volume spikes. \n\nLower to $35 and work your way up a dollar at a time. First 7-14 days are volatile but after that it’s the most consistent campaign to run.\n \n\nFor budget I recommend starting at $500-$1,000 maximum . But minimum $250\n\n\nYou need 50-100 sales conversions before starting this campaign type don’t use this without any data. \n\nWhen scaling you can increase the budget verily rapidly 5-10% a day conservatively or $250-$500 every 3 days aggressively. You go out of learning pretty fast with this campaign strategy.\n\nThe Creative Remix Strategy.\n\nHow to find winning creatives, remix and optimize them for better ROAS.\n\nCircling back to the prospecting stage..\n\nWhat we do is find the best concept in each weekly test.. And remix it..\n\nHere’s an example \n\nWe remix the Hook/CTA of the USC ad.\n\nDepending on watch time to CTR. \n\nOr if it's static we call out to a different audience/desire.\n\nWe basically put out quality over quantity.\n\nEX if we are trying to optimize watch time: |Hook 1|Hook 2|Hook 3| Hook Pack 1|. \n\nIf we’re trying to test CTR with a stronger CTA: |CTA 1|CTA 2|CTA 3| CTA pack 1|. \n\nAnd we let it run for 7 days and then optimized further. \n\nLet facebook optimize the ads that will perform the best. \n\nOn static we test desire/pain based angle over a proven concept. \n\nFinding the Who, How, What.\n\nWho are you talking to?\n\nHow does your product/service solve your avatars problems?\n\nWhat does your product do?\n\nThese are the three things you need in a creative/ad copy. \n\n\nFinding your “Breakeven KPIs”\nThis in my opinion is very important to running successful ads.\n\nYou need to find your break even CPRs..\n\nWhat CPR is unprofitable with spent employees and COGS?\n\nHere’s a formula to calculate your breakeven CPR: anything above this is unprofitable anything below this is profitable. \n\nEx. $20 a lead, $150 an appointment, or $34 a sale. \n\nBreak-Even CPR = Profit Margin (as a decimal) \n                                Revenue Per Sale​\n\nAs the platform continues to update I'll do the same. \n\nThese types of post takes a long time to write and perfect. \n\nI’ll try to answer as many questions as possible.\n\nI have a goal to help 1,000 learn Facebook ads this year. \n\nCrush it in 2025!\n\n\n",

    "title": "The New Facebook Ads Strategy That We Use To Scale Facebook Ads ($30M In Ad Spend Since 2018) ",
    "selftext": "Hello Redditors!\n\nIn this post, I will share our New and updated Facebook ads strategy, which we use to reduce the cpa and scale our and clients' brands.\n\nFor those that read my post for the first time I have been using Facebook ads since the start of 2018. I have seen the days when we were able to scale business with just one ad and throwing that ad in lookalike, interests, custom audience ad sets for an entire year.\n\nI also witnessed the major impact of IOS 14.5 update when all the ad accounts just stoped performing in one day. Me and my team have witnessed almost all of it. The last time we changed our strategy was two years ago. This time we haven't made radical changes but rather added some improvements that help our our and our clients ad accounts minimize the overall cpa which helps scaling.\n\nTo get the most value from the post, read it entirely about two times because I'm also going to share the little things that, if applied, can improve your overall ad performance.\n\nHere are some screenshots before and after screenshots of one of our client's decreased cpa month over month.\n\n* [Before](https://ibb.co/vkNcBsS)\n* [After](https://ibb.co/Xy9Lvvj)\n* [Month to date ](https://ibb.co/x8CKmMk)\n\nLet's go ahead and get started.\n\n**1) AD ACCOUNT STRUCTURE**\n\n* We still simplify our accounts as much as possible. We do that to read data faster and to give Meta clear objectives that we want to reach.\n* All of our campaigns are CBO campaigns. We mainly use dynamic creative for those accounts where it's still available and for those where the dynamic creative is not available we use flexible ads.\n* Each new test is a new ad set that has it's own Code. We test new ad concepts, new images, new videos, new hooks, new headlines on the best-performing images, new CTA's, image headline size, new image backgrounds of winning headlines, etc.\n* We use broad targeting for all the ad sets.\n* Here is a screenshot of our ad sets inside of the campaign - [click here ](https://ibb.co/FxvkRWB)\n\n**One Offer Campaign** - For all clients and our brands, we always have an offer campaign where we advertise an offer that helps us acquire customers. This is not your 20%, 30%, or 50% off your first purchase offer.\n\nThe days of creating retargeting ads that say get 20% off your first purchase are gone. They work, but you are not at scale, plus you don't want to really acquire a customer based on price sensitivity. In most cases, that is not a loyal customer and will go to another brand if they offer an even bigger discount.\n\nMost offer campaigns are bundles—BUY 2 GET ONE FREE. Bundling products generate the most sales, especially if you have at least two items. Add another complimentary product you want to introduce to the customer for free.\n\nUsually, the two best-selling products also have the highest repurchase rate. We love bundle offers because they work well and help us increase the AOV, which allows us to acquire the customer for more.\n\nIt's really important when you create bundle offers to create the offer's CPA goal. If your average AOV is $65 and your existing CPA goal is $25, then by creating a bundle priced at $79, you also need to increase the CPA goal to, let's say, $30 - $33.\n\nThis offer campaign only has ads about that offer. If you want to test another offer create another campaign. Don't add 50% sales campaigns in this campaign becasue that is a completaly different customer who is more price sensitive. I have seen many ad accounts where alot of times sales ads are just added in the most random campaigns together with other ads.\n\n**Main Campaign Per Country**  - This would be advertising the best selling product. Inside the campaign we are testing ad new ad concepts. Check the screenshot that I shared previosuly.\n\n**Influencer Campaign -** Previously, we used influencer ads under the main campaign. We don't run any special promo codes with influencers; we just give briefs with bullet points on what they need to mention about our product.\n\nThe reason we run a specific influencer campaign is becasue we want to test the performance of the influencer. This campaign has it's own UTM so we can check the performance in one of our third party attribution tools ( we use Northbeam and Triple Whale) .\n\n**Catalog Retargeting Campaign** - this is not for every brand that we work for. We use catalog retargeting campaign only with brands that have a lot of products. Either that's cosmetics, clothing, jewelry.\n\nIt is important to note that this campaign will spend a maximum of 10% of the whole daily budget.\n\n**One Time Offer Campaign -** These are your Summer Sales, Labor Day, Halloween Sales, Black Friday Sales Campaigns.\n\nThere are some clients where we use % OFF offers. Since this campaign usually has limited time we also use retargeting ad sets in the campaign.\n\nThe retargeting ad set in the sales campaign consists of\n\n* Video engagement custom audience 365 days\n* Any other social engagement custom audience 365 days\n* FB &amp; IG followers\n* All website visitors 180 days\n* Custom Klavyio audience of all customers who have bought\n* Custom Klavyio audience of customers who are the most frequent buyers\n\nThis ad set has all the ads in it. [Click here](https://ibb.co/C76Bxzr) to see the SHORT PERIOD SALES CAMPAIGN EXAMPLE.\n\nThe reason we have a retargeting ad set is that we want to make sure that we also reach of or most HOT audiences. BTW This ad set is never the highest spender but when it spends it usually gets low cost per purchase.\n\nThe reason why it's not the highest spender is because it uses custom audiences and has the limit of audience that can be reached.\n\nThis is the only time we use retargeting ad set. We don't use retargeting ad sets anywhere else.\n\n**2) AD ACCOUNT OPTIMIZATION**\n\nThis year Meta has been all over the place and it has impacted the way we look at increasing campaign budgets.\n\n* We look at the last seven days.\n* If the CPA goals are reached, we increase the budget every other day by 5% ( When spending at least $500)\n* When we are spending less than $500 a day we increase it by 20-50% to reach the $500 daily spend.\n* When increasing spending 5% every other day, you can actually more than double the $500 ad spend in less than a month; continue to do that for two, three,  six, and twelve months. We are talking about tens of thousands a day in ad spend. Plus, you don't f up the business by scaling too aggressively as well. As long as you can spend 5% more every other day, which in most cases you can, it's great.  Slow is fast. Fast is slow.\n* We don't make decisions on one bad day. We make decisions on last 7 days. Period. One bad day - don't care.\n* For the accounts that we have worked on the longest, we use automated rules that automatically cut the losing ads and increase the campaign budget by 5% like clockwork. We don't do this for all of our clients. Only for those who we know the target numbers down to pennies.\n\nOver the years we have seen so many things that we don't react to bad days anymore. One of our account's bad days was yesterday, when we generated 60% less in sales than usual, which was weird, but when we analyzed the data, nothing changed. Today, the sales are back up and some.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this year, Facebook has been crazier than usual. Everyone is dealing with the same issues.\n\nHow many of you that are reading this have tried to increase their spend by 30% after few great days of advertising and then the campaign completaly tanks? We have had this issue.\n\nThat's why we moved to 5% increases, in that we don't make crazy swings, and it's actually reasonable for the campaign to adjust.\n\nGoing back to ad structure points. Not all the campaigns have the same CPA goals. If we advertise bundles, the CPA goal will be higher. Even influencer campaigns have their own cpa goals.\n\n**3) CREATIVE TESTING**\n\nIn 2024 creative testing is more important than it was in 2018 and 2023. If you look at the brands that are crushing it they test a lot of creatives.\n\nIt would be great if we had the same scenario as in 2018 when you could scale with just one ad for the whole year and not worry about figuring out a creative testing budget and hiring ad design and video editing teams.\n\nThe world has changed a lot since 2018. Social channels have also changed a lot and become content-heavy. The more content is published, the longer the user can spend time on it. Meta is battling against TikTok and YouTube for user attention.\n\nBusinesses need to play by 2024 channel rules, that is, if they want to succeed in Facebook.\n\nWe test anywhere from 200 - 300 ads a week across 11 brands. ( 9 clients and 2 our brands) ( [screenshot from our weekly tracker ](https://ibb.co/d4scs3R))\n\nWe have improved our creative testing process which helps us achieve these numbers. Also really important to mention is that we have a graphic design and video editor team. It would be silly if, after 6 years of being in the game, we wouldn't create a process where we are able to print ads.\n\nThere are agencies and brands that do even crazier numbers. If you are reading this and you are just starting out and thinking, how can I create this? This is only for big teams. My answer to you is you don't need to test this many creatives.\n\nHere is our process:\n\n1. It all starts with the research. We do weekly research for every single of our brands and clients to find new ad concepts that we haven't tested or in general new creative ideas.\n2. We write the concepts in a spreadsheet - [click here for the layout of the sheet](https://ibb.co/F0xg6cY)\n3. The team decides on the concept.\n4. Write the ad copy &amp; headline.\n5. Gather examples of other ads.\n6. Create the creative brief for the image designer\n7. Image designer creates the images\n8. Launch the test\n9. If the test is successful - expand the ad concept ( create a video, improve the best-performing image max two times)\n10. Repeat.\n11. If the test is not successful and does not get sales, go back to step 3 and test a new concept.\n\nWe always start the ad concept tests with images because they can be created the fast st. Previously we started with images and vid os. When we started with videos, a lot of times, at least 70% of them didn't even get spent or performed, which was a wasted resource.\n\nNow, we validate our ad concepts with images and then expand in videos, animations, etc.\n\nWe test new things 70% of the time and improve the winning ads 30% of the time.\n\n**4) MUST HAVE AD ANGLES THAT WE TRY TO MAKE WORK.**\n\nWe have tested hundreds of ad concepts (ad angles); here are the main ones we always use in all our ad accounts.\n\n* **Founders story** - This is a must to stand out from other competitors. A lot o  brands are not ready to show the founders behind their brands, and I respect that. Those who are prepared to show themselves this ad always crush it. This ad helps build a connection with the customers. It's not a random dropshipping product that a kid is selling. The real people behind the business, along with their families, that also need to eat.\n* **US vs Them** - Since there are many competitors for almost every product, this angle works well because it makes you stand out from the crowd.  This does not apply if you are a fashion br nd. In that case, you just want to pretend you are the only fashion brand in the world. We usually list at least five things where we have the advantage over competitors to make it more compelling. Sometimes, just calling out free shipping for all orders works.\n* **Podcast angle—A**s podcasts have become even more popular over the years, we always ensure that we have an interview/podcast angle. It's a video, and it blends in well in the feed.\n* **Before-and-afters**—This works really well. Please search how other brands do before-and-after ads because they can get banned. Luckily, there are so many examples out there.\n* **Review ads** are great retargeting ads. They convince the customer that your product is worth buying. The more of these you have, the better.\n* **Problem ads** - these will be your highest spenders.\n\n**5) LITTLE AD HACKS TO IMPROVE AD PERFORMANCE**\n\nOver the years, we have tested a lot of things that improve ad performance.\n\nHere are some tricks that we use to increase engagement in our ads.\n\n* When a person makes a comment, we always respond with an answer and then ask the question. This helps increase the chance that the person will come back and comment again.\n* When an ad is starting to take off we use the comment section to post review screenshots of our customers and sometimes even US vs Them images.\n* We really try to utilize the comment section as much as possible, especially if you have clients who have shared reviews in image and video format.\n\nI don't see many brands doing this. Don't do it for every single ad; only for those who are the best performers. Doing this will increase the engagement in the ads, and Meta will push it even more, which usually results in lower CPMs, lower cost per click, and lower cost per purchase.\n\nTry it and let me know how it goes.\n\n**6) TRACKING THE RIGHT NUMBERS**\n\nThis point is outside of Facebook ads. I will make this point as short as possible. The goal of every business is to be profitable. In order to be in the business, you need profit, except when you have millions invested in from investors, and you don't care.\n\nI'm talking to the everyday business owner. Every business ultimately cares only about profit, so you need to track your profit daily.\n\nWe do it all the time.  We want to see the impact our winning ads make on business. If we find a winning ad crushing it on meta but don't see that in our business numbers, something is not right.\n\nMeta can be tricky with their reports on ads managers. That's why we also use third-party softwares that helps us track our daily profit.\n\nPlease track your daily profits. I have seen far too many ad accounts destroyed by not tracking daily profit.\n\nHere is one that I recently got access to: [May ](https://ibb.co/mhGNyGK)and [July](https://ibb.co/L9rRGH0)\n\nP.S. I have other posts where I go into details about numbers.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed the post. Thanks for reading. See you in the next one.",

    "title": "Inside a $4.1M Facebook Ad Account (Here’s What’s Working)",
    "selftext": "Good day, Redditors\n\nMy goal with this post is to demonstrate that a complicated ad account structure is not necessary to scale your Facebook ads.\n\nHere's a look inside at what's working for a DTC Brand's [Facebook ad account](https://ibb.co/nhkHy46), which has spent **$4,170,728.55** in ad spend.\n\n**1) SIMPLE AD ACCOUNT STRUCTURE**\n\nYou cannot get much simpler than having just one CBO campaign.\n\nThis campaign has:\n\n* Prospecting ads (Top of the funnel)\n* Retargeting ads (Middle of the funnel &amp; bottom of the funnel) -\n* Offer ads.\n\nHow does the campaign scale? By increasing the budget for the whole campaign. You don't need to duplicate the campaign to scale your ad account.\n\nOften, when you overcomplicate the ad account structure by duplicating and scaling, you end up encountering audience overlap, resulting in increased CPM and CPA as you reach the same audience you previously targeted with your campaigns.\n\nWe made the mistake of duplicate scaling years ago, and since 2022, we have stuck to increasing the budget for the campaign.\n\nLooking at the first screenshot, you can see that the campaign has recorded 262,000 purchases; it can't fail due to the vast amount of data. That should be the campaign's goal: to make as many purchases as possible while meeting your CPA goal. \n\nThe more purchases the campaign has, the better it will perform over time.  Now let's jump into creative testing.\n\n**2) SIMPLE TESTING SYSTEM.**\n\nHere is how the [ad account looks](https://ibb.co/MkpKtt2R) on the ad set level with the setup:\n\n* Broad targeting. (Targeting is handled by creatives, especially given the amount of data their ad account contains)\n* 1 Concept per Ad Set, with 3-5 unique ad variations of each concept.\n* Each week we test 4-6 ad concepts.\n* We don't miss a single week without testing new ad concepts.\n\nHere are the testing rules:\n\n* Each ad set runs for 7 days\n* A winning ad will have a CPA below the target + will record 100+ purchases during 7 days.\n* A losing ad will have a small spend over a 7-day period.\n* A losing ad will have a CPA above the target.\n\nIt's crucial to measure AOV right beside the CPA, because at times your ads can exceed CPA targets and, at the same time, bring in higher-quality customers who spend more, thus generating higher AOV.\n\n**3) HERO OFFER &amp; HERO PRODUCT.**\n\nThis brand has a simple Hero offer that we use to acquire customers at scale. Having a HERO offer and a great product is the easiest way to scale a brand.\n\nMany businesses have scaled into tens of millions in revenue just because of having a HERO offer alone.\n\nA HERO offer not only attracts new clients but also helps in retaining them by delivering exceptional value.\n\nI highy suggest doing competitor research in your own niche or similar niches and look at what kind of HERO offers the best brands have.\n\nMany people think that offering a 20% discount on the first purchase is a HERO offer. It's not.\n\nExamples of great HERO offers:\n\n* Buy 1, get on 1 FREE\n* Buy 2, get one FREE\n* BUY 3, GET a (popular product) as a gift.\n\n**4) A SIMPLE BUYERS JOURNEY.**\n\nThis brand's conversion is through the roof, simply because of the simplicity of the website.\n\n* Easy to read\n* Easy to understand\n* Few clicks to a purchase.\n\nI often see extremely complicated websites that ultimately have a low conversion rate.\n\nOnce a potential customer lands on the website, they must understand exactly what you're selling within the first few seconds; otherwise, you'll have a high bounce rate which will ultimately result in a low conversion rate, as the majority of visitors leave.\n\n**5) SUMMARY**\n\nFocus on what truly matters - your HERO offer and your customer's buyer journey, and simplify your advertising system.\n\nIt should not be complicated. The complicated you make it the harder it will be to scale.\n\nThere is a reason why there is a saying, \"Simplicity scales complexity fails.\"\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nSee you in the next one.",

    "title": "What I Think Will Happen With Facebook Ads 2024 After Spending More Than $20M In Ad Spend Since 2018.",
    "selftext": "Hello, fellow Redditors!\n\nWelcome to 2024. I wish you all a prosperous 2024. \n\nIn this post, I want to talk about how to go about advertising in 2024 and what challenges will be down the road for this year. Before I talk about 2024, I need to go back to 2018 and reel it back into 2024.\n\nP.S. This is my longest post yet.\n\n- THE YEAR 2018\n\nI started to advertise on Facebook back in 2018, the golden years. Back then, all you need to have is a somewhat decent product, a picture of the product, for example, a WOLF MUG (hopefully someone here remembers wolf mug year). \n\nAfter you got a decent product a picture, and a product page, all you needed to do is put in Facebook ads, create an engagement campaign so that the ad gathers engagement, and then use that ad's post ID to run a conversion campaign.\n\nIn order to make sure that the conversion campaign can be scaled, you could hack the ads manager into using targeting like lookalikes, interest stacks, retargeting stacks, lookalike stacks, and the holy grail \"Engaged Shoppers\" interest. \n\nThat's all you had to do. There was no need for more than just one ad and a bunch of ads targeting hacking. \n\nWe found a lot of success back in 2018. \n\nWe were able to scale a bike accessory company brand from $20k a month to $240k a month in just 10 months.\n\nAnd we did it with just one ad and tons of looklikee stacks, interest stacks.\n\nIt was easy back then.\n\n- THE YEAR 2019\n\nNow in the year 2019, the same thing worked, only back then, there was way more competition selling wolf mugs, which meant that the product page needed to be improved in order for it to convert better. \n\nRegarding ads, all you needed was still a wolf mug picture and tons of ads manager hacking. \n\nStill, the same principles applied. \n\n- 2019, 2020 UP UNTIL IOS 14 \n\nThese were the years of TOFU, MOFU, and BOFU advertising structures and approaches. \n\nBack then, this approach worked like crazy. We thought that we were gods. \n\nTarget this person with interest in tofu, then retarget social media engagers or everyone who has seen our ads, visitors to our website and retarget them with simple testimonial ads and the good old 10-20% off ads. \n\nEveryone who had a decent product was able to make a killing with Facebook ads. \n\nFacebook media buyers were acting like TONY ROBBINS jumping on the stage and just sharing their complex Facebook advertising structures.\n\nThe more complex the structure, the better. It felt like everyone was competing, whoever had the craziest structures. Back then, I even saw 100 active campaign structures. \n\nPeople were literally living in Facebook ads manager. \n\n- APRIL 2021. ARMAGEDON. THE END OF TOFU, MOFU, BOFU, AND ANY OTHER FU.\n\nIOS 14. The pixel killer. \n\nI remember this so clearly because it impacted our campaign results like no other. \n\nAfter a month, the mofu and tofu campaigns didn't work. The tracking was dead. \n\nSince we had an agency, a lot of clients got scared and dropped us. \n\nThis was the end of hacking the ads manager. This update forced Meta to improve its algorithm and introduce aggravated event measurement.\n\nThe rest of the year, we struggled to advertise until Q4, when all we had to do was advertise offer ads, and the money printer was back on.\n\n- THE YEAR 2022. \n\nTesting about 8 new ads every month for our brand and our clients.\n\nMainly using a stack of interests and a stack of lookalikes.\n\nIn January 2022, we signed this one client with the capacity to create ads and we were also building our in-house content department in order to scale creative testing.\n\nWe analyzed:\n\n- Facebook and Instagram content - what type of content are we seeing daily?\n\nTurns out we were seeing content that we were interested in.\n\n- Facebook and Instagram ads - again, most of the ads that were shown to us and that we reacted to were the stuff that we were interested in.\n\nInteresting...\n\nSeeing this made us realize that Facebook's algorithm has become more sophisticated, which looking back now, was obvious. \n\nImagine Facebook pixel was introduced back in 2013. They have been collecting data for almost a decade. \n\nThey were collecting data on what ads you react and go to the website, what ads you need to see in order for a brand to convince you that this is the right product for you and you buy. They already had billions of data points on billions of users. \n\nLet's continue...\n\nThis is still January 2022.\n\nAfter realizing that Facebook's algorithm was becoming more powerful, we thought about - \"What if we start researching consumer psychology and customer behavior and understand what type of content our target customer likes to see? \n\nAt this time, our team was reading two books - Cashvertising and Breakthrough Advertising.\n\nAfter reading these, we decided to start creating ads that speak to our target customers by introducing awareness stages\n\nLUnaware ads - ads that take an unaware audience to the most aware audience.\n\nProblem-aware - ads that talk to people who know about their problem.\n\nSolution-aware ads - ads that target people who understand that they have a problem but don't know which solution to choose.\n\nProduct aware - ads that target people who understand their problem and also know how that is the way on how to solve their problem but don't know which brand/product to choose.\n\nMost aware - people who already know everything about their problem, how to solve it, what product to choose, they are just waiting for the right time to buy from you.\n\nThis was also the year when we understood that creating a lot of ads and testing them is not possible if we are hacking ads manager at the same time.\n\nIf we are about to test a new ad creative, how can I test it if at the same time we are testing \"audiences\". It's not doable.\n\nThat's why in 2022, we started to test new creatives with a broad audience (only location, age, and gender), look like stack and interests stack, basically one ad with 3 different ad sets. One for broad, one for lookalikes, and one for interests\n\nOnce we saw that Broad was outperforming interests and lookalikes in a super-niched market, we understood that it was time to abandon any interest or lookalike targeting and go fully broad. \n\nBefore we did it, we wanted to make sure that Broad truly works, and we tested that for all of our clients, and it outperformed all of the interests and lookalikes.\n\nWhat was even crazier was the fact that the campaigns only became better with time. We spent more money on them, they gathered more data, and for some accounts the CPA decreased in half. If we were paying $35 to acquire customers, now we were paying $20.\n\n- THE YEAR 2023\n\nLast year was incredible for Facebook ads. We had fully adopted Broad, and we were all in on creating as many ads as possible in order to grow the accounts.\n\nWe fully adopted consumer psychology in our ad creation which helped our brands to stand apart from other competitors and crush them. \n\nIt felt like a lot of advertisers started to understand how the algorithm works and trust it. \n\nTherefore a lot of accounts were running broad targeting and focusing on creative.\n\nAt the same time, I saw brands who understood the principle of letting algorithms dictate whom to show the ads to but, at the same time, forgot how much ad testing it really requires.\n\nSome brands test 5-10 new creatives a month and think that is enough. At the same time screaming that ads don't work.\n\nOf course, they don't work if you create 5-10 creatives a month. By creating a few content pieces, you don't even have any data on what type of ads resonate with your audience and what don't.\n\nIt takes a lot of testing to understand what is the type of content your target resonates with. \n\nOnce you understand that, it's easy to create 100 similar versions to that type of ad content. \n\nI understand that in the last line, it's easy to create 100 similar versions. \n\nI looked back at our ads launched tracking sheet, where we track how many new ads we launch every week. I calculated that, on average, we launched around 54 new ads a month. Meaning that for one brand in a year we tested around 650 ads.\n\nThat's a lot of tests. Also doing so many tests, it's a high possibility to create ads that can be scaled like crazy, which we did.\n\nThis may sound like a lot. But yet again, this week I was reminded that we are also human. We encountered a brand that was producing.... wait for it......\n\nStill waiting for it.... 400 video ads a month... Yes. I thought that we were doing a lot of tests. But this one just completely shocked me. \n\nSo anyway in 2023, since a lot of advertisers adopted broad targeting and were focused on ad creative, competition was rising. When competition rises, it means that they take away your potential customers. Which of course, happened to everyone.\n\nThat's why a lot of advertisers in 2023 saw really bad advertising performance. \n\nWe also experienced some bad days, but those were rare. We researched our top competitors, and a lot of them were starting to create way more ad creatives and, most importantly, better ad creatives.\n\nAgain competition breeds excellence.\n\nI'm not afraid to say that those who have a hard time succeeding with Facebook ads either have a bad product or suck at creating ads. \n\nAnd that's okay. Cause there are literally hundreds of thousands of brands who suck at creating ads. \n\nIt is what it is. I know it's hard to admit that, but that's how it is. \n\nThe best part about this is that everyone has the same opportunity = time. Time to learn more about how to create ads that actually resonate with your target audience. \n\nWe measure our ad success rate, and we call it - HIT RATE. Our average hit rate is about 24%. This means that out of all the ads that we launch, 24% hit home run and can be scaled, which is pretty good but not good enough. \n\n24% means that there are competitors who can probably achieve 50% and take away some of our customers. \n\nIn my most popular post here, I was writing that I like to think about an ad as a salesperson. \n\nA salesperson who does not sleep, or eat, who is constantly selling. The biggest companies in the world have tons of salespeople working for them. \n\nAds are our salespeople.\n\n- HOW WE APPROACH CONTENT CREATION &amp; TESTING.\n\nThe first step is we do customer research. (P.S I have a post about research, you can find it, which explains how we go about researching customers)\n\nThe second step is we not down the main desires of the customer. \n\nThe third step is writing down at least 50+ ad angles, the reason why so many is because it's easy to come up with the first 10-20, aka a high possibility that your competitors also use those marketing messeges. The next 20 are pretty hard, and that's where the gold is hidden.\n\nThe fourth step is choosing one desire + one marketing angle and creating that marketing angle in all 5 awareness stages. \n\nWe usually start with the product-aware stage and then move into the solution and problem-aware stage. The unaware stage ad creation is the last since it's the hardest to crack.\n\nWhy don't we touch the most aware stage in the beginning? Because that's mostly a retargeting ad. Our core goal is usually to acquire new customers, that's why we go after product-aware, solution-aware, and problem-aware.\n\nAfter the ads are created, we usually launch tests on specific days, Mondays and Tuesdays, there is no real explanation behind it, we have just stuck to this approach and trained our campaigns that way. \n\nObviously, testing is being done under\n\nONE CBO CAMPAIGN ( we only have One CBO campaign per business objective structure, meaning if we are advertising in different campaigns, that would be a separate campaign, the same thing applies to different offers, a separate campaign)\n\nMost of our accounts don't have more than 1-3 campaigns running. \n\nUnder the CBO conversion campaign, we do testing and scaling at the same time. \n\nThere is a dedicated ad set for scaling which consists of best-performing ads from tests that we have done. \n\nAnd the rest of the ad sets are Dynamic creative tests, where we test one messege in one deliverable at a time. For example, \"angle name\" with 3 videos, the only thing that is different in the 3 videos is the first 3 seconds. Additionally to the videos we also use two ad copies and two headlines. This helps meta create 12 possible ads, which gives you a higher possibility to hit on a winning ad. \n\nThis should be common sense if you test 1 video with one copy and one headline. \n\nBut I tested 3 videos, 2 copies, and 2 headlines under one ad, this gives me 12 ads. Thus higher probability of hitting a home run.\n\nWe launch the test, and wait for 48 hours. Meanwhile, the next tests are already being created. \n\nAfter 48 hours, we come back, take notes, and look at what data points can be improved, for example, for higher hook rates, we create 6 more hook variations and retest the same messege.\n\nBasically, we always test at least 2 new tests a week and create 2 new improvements every week. \n\nSometimes when we have found a really good message that resonates with the audience, we create as many similar versions as possible. (literally sometimes 50 ads)\n\nWe don't abandon our ideas fast. We always ask ourselves what we can improve in this messege. This is what we have found out really working for us.\n\nA lot of people create ads, test something, and they don't work, and then they scream Facebook ads don't work. \n\nIf you are that person. Good luck to you. \n\nAll of this is actually simple, it just requires doing.\n\nCreating a lot of ads is not that hard as well. We now have smartphones, you don't need high-end pictures or videos to create great ads. In fact, the more the ad looks like an ad, the worse it is. \n\nThere are a ton of small brands that have figured out content creation. You need to find your own way and your approach. \n\n- THE YEAR 2024 PREDICTION.\n\nSo here it goes. I believe that more people will start to adopt broad targeting and focus on content creation. A lot of people here probably have tried Advantage +, which is essentially broad targeting but with a spice of heavy mofu and of targeting.\n\nIf you or your agency, your media buyer still uses tofu, mofu, bofu, well I don't have to tell you what needs to be done. I actually like the saying of Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank. \"You gotta take it behind the barn and shoot it,\" or, in other words, fire them. \n\nI also mentioned the word \"HITRATE\" if there is a competition that has adopted broad targeting and ad creation in terms of testing a lot of content to find the winning creative so it can be scaled. \n\nThat means that our main priority should be creating ads at high \"HITRATE\" aka winning ads that can take on a lot of budget. \n\nWhat does it mean for all the advertisers?\n\nYou, Me, and We all need to become better at creating ads that resonate with our target audience. If you don't do that, you are F********. \n\nI don't know if NBA is a good analogy here, but over time NBA players have become better. That means that the barrier of entry to play in nba has risen. \n\nThe same thing will happen with Facebook ads. The barrier of entry has risen.\n\nBut... Don't get discouraged. We all have 24 hours a day. We all can choose what we do as advertisers and ad creators. Do we scroll ig, TikTok, or do we dig deep and try to understand our customer down to their whole being?\n\nThis is not only about ads. It's about the whole thing. There are a lot of big brands, legacy brands, out there. You know what they don't have? A lot of them don't have a loyal customer base. \n\nUnderstand your customer, create content that resonates with your customer, use it in the ads, use it on the website, use it in email marketing, and use it in social channels. Connect with your target customer. \n\nIf you will connect with your target customer you will win. \n\nI wish you all a successful 2024. Beat your competition! See you out in the field.\n\nThanks for reading.",

    "title": "Basic Media Buying On Facebook Ads Is Dead. ( Lessons After Spending $10M+ In Facebook Ads In 2024)",
    "selftext": "Good day Redditors,\n\n2024 has been pretty brutal for a lot of media buyers, advertisers, brands. The brutal truth is that 2025 is going to be even more challenging if you do not master marketing.\n\nI have been in e-commerce and advertising on meta since 2018.  I have seen it all. The good old scaling days with one ad for the entire year, IOS 14 armageddon till today.  The trend that I see is that every single year there is more competition and the competition gets better.\n\nThis means that if you want to stay in business, you need to get better.  I want to share what things won't work anymore in 2025, and then I will share what s**ix crucial things you need to do in order to do well on Meta Ads**.\n\n# Things that won't work anymore.\n\n**1) Relying On Media Buying Skills.**\n\nMedia buying is simple now. AI handles that. This means that media buying alone is dying and won't get you anywhere. I remember back in 2018 all we did was media buying for hours with just one ad. Used lookalikes, interests back then broad wasn't even a thing. We could never imagine that media buying can become so simple. Those were good days.\n\n**2) Making Decisions Based On Facebook Ads Manager Is Like Driving Blindfolded.**\n\nDays on accurate Facebook ad tracking are also gone. 70% of IOS devices have opted out of tracking. I don't know the number for Andriod devices. Who wants to be tracked? Have you allowed tracking on your Device?\n\nYou simply cannot win if you don't use a third-party tracking system that helps you with decision-making. When I audit an ad account that hasn't used a third-party tracking system, and there are many out there, it's crazy the amount of data that you lose. A lot of times ad that shows that is not giving you a good cpa is an ad that is actually getting a good cpa.  But since you just make your decisions based on ads manager, you turn it off, and then you wonder why you don't have conversions.\n\n**3) You Cannot Grow A Business Alone.**\n\nYou need to grow a team with people who are better at things where you suck.  You need video editors, videographers, and graphic designers.\n\nYears ago, when it came to creating ads, I understood that great-performing ads and multiple of them can't be created by just one person. Think car factory. An ad consists of multiple parts.\n\n* Clear buyer persona\n* Research\n* Copy Writing\n* Graphic design\n\n99.9% of the time, great copywriters are not great graphic designers, and vice versa.\n\nTo be good at advertising, you need a team to compete against other teams.\n\n**4) Not Understanding Customer Behavior and Buyer Journey**\n\n You need to think like a brand marketer. The \"SMALL STUFF\" matters more than ever. A click on an ad only gets you so far. You cannot win if you don't improve:\n\n* Website shopping experience ( people who usually struggle have S\\*\\*t shopping experience)\n* Social proof ( Proof of other people loving your product): without this, you will lose.\n* Customer experience - what comes after the purchase.\n* Content that resonates with your BUYER PERSONA.  Both on ads and the website.\n\nAdvertisers and marketers who ignore these are dinosaurs. They will lose.\n\n**5) Not Improving Your Website Experience (CRO)**\n\nVisits on your website are more expensive than it has ever been, and it's not going to be cheaper. **Revenue Per Session** matters a lot. You need to do everything in your power to make sure that people spend more on your website.\n\nYou don't stand a chance if you don't try to improve your RPS cause your competitors are doing that.\n\n**6) Not Standing Out From Your Competitors**\n\nWhy should someone buy from you? Use storytelling and humor in your advertising. Don't just run ads like everyone else. Everyone else does not get results. When you look at your competitor ads, don't just copy them. Make your own unique version of that.\n\nOverall, doing mediocre inputs regarding media buying, ad creation, website experience, not trying to understand numbers is a guaranteed way to lose.\n\n**7) Testing For Testing Sake,  Not Having Clear Idea And Goals When Testing Creatives.**\n\nFar to many times I see ad accounts that test for just testing sake. There is no clear understanding of what we are testing. You can create 1000 creatives, but if you don't have a clear understanding of what you test, you will never find winning ads.\n\nThere are different messeges on each awareness level. You cannot create few ads and then look at ad set audience reach predictions and think that this ad will reach 60 million. It won't. If you have no idea what you are testing, you will have bad tests, and bad tests will have low reach.\n\n# Things That Will Help You Win At Advertising On Meta.\n\n**1) MAKE SURE  THAT  YOU CAN SPEND MORE THAN  YOUR  COMPETITORS ON ACQUIRING A CUSTOMER.**\n\nNumbers in business is the most important part. People who desiagree witht this should not own a business. That means that you need to have good profit margins so you can actually afford to invest in marketing.\n\nAdvertising will only get more expensive. Having numbers on your side from the beginning gives you an edge over your competitors. If your competitors can only spend $30 to acquire a customer and you can spend $50 to acquire that customer, they don't stand a chance just because of the MATH alone. You can outspend them.\n\nAt that point, it does not even matter who has the best marketing or the best product; you will be able to show your ads more frequently than them, and by default, just because people see you more, they remember you more, and you get sales.\n\nThere are lot of people who turn off their ads, but marketing is something that should not be stopped ever. If you do not market = you do not matter.  People who turn off their ads even for a single day lose on a customer who was about to buy, but now, instead, since they have seen your ads, they also see your competitor ads, but you stopped.\n\nYour competitor didn't. They were in the buyers phase, they saw the competitor and bought from them.\n\nSo have numbers on your side so you can spend more on ads. 60%+ profit margin is a good place to start. Regarding AOV, it's a minimum of $50 to help you fight increasing CPM's.\n\n**2) HAVING A HERO OFFER THAT INCREASES YOUR AOV.**\n\nIn most cases, rookie brand owners and marketers just think that they need to offer 20% OFF their first purchase is all they need. When, in fact, your most loyal customers do not buy because you are cheaper than others.\n\nPeople who buy because of the price will not return cause there is always someone else who can offer a cheaper product.\n\nThat's why you need an offer that is centered around VALUE. The customer gets value after they buy. Create bundles, create buy x get free, create buy x get x off type of offers. Make sure that these offers increase the average order value so you can afford to spend more on ads..\n\n**3) BUILD TRUST AROUND YOUR BUSINESS.**\n\nNobody trusts random brands anymore. Your biggest hurdle isn't creative, media buying, or targeting- it's legitimacy.\n\nBefore running ads I suggest:\n\n* Sending your product to micro-influencers to get video content/reviews about the product that you can use as ads and publish on your product page. People trust people. They only trust websites with proof content.\n* Create US vs. them, Before &amp; After content both on ads and the website.\n\nIf a person sees your ad and asks if this is legitimate, It's not your ads that is killing your performance it's TRUST.\n\nI'm pretty sure that all of your are aware of scam stores, people have been burnt. People are more careful now.. BUILD TRUST.\n\nDon't have empty social media without content. If you don't have content on your social, you are missing out on a lot of conversions.  People don't always click on the website; they click on the social page, and they google you; if there is nothing, then you should expect nothing.\n\n**4) YOU NEED TO KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER.**\n\nThis goes without saying. Making a person feel like you know them is incredibly powerful. You must spend time researching your BUYER PERSONA.\n\nKnowing your buyer persona allows you to create detailed ad content and landing pages that speak to to them.\n\nThis alone can help you make ads that perform for months and years. There is nothing more powerful than people feeling that you understand them. At the same time there is nothing more worse than people thinking **\"oh another sh\\*t ad, why I'm seeing this?\"**\n\nMost of the people who have bad results today have those ads that give that reaction. You need to avoid this at all costs. Spend time on researching, call your customers ask them why they buy. It will help you create better ads, better product pages, better landing pages, better emails.\n\nAMAZON is a great example of how to care about the customer.\n\n**5) FIND YOUR OWN AD OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY.**\n\nThe truth of the matter is you can’t take anything as gospel. You have to test, refine, and optimize. We have gone from using Only ABO to now using only CBO.  Things change. I have seen ad accounts do good with both.\n\nI haven't seen any ad accounts that only use ASC+ and do well.  Figure out your own combination.\n\nAttribution windows must be set correctly. We have gone away from anything that has a view in it. We either run 7-day click or 1-day click campaigns.  This year has been full of algorithm changes that have impacted the way ads optimize, and we have seen that when meta makes decisions based on view attribution, it just inflates numbers; it also spends money on ads that should not get spent.\n\nIf anyone wants to know my ad account strategy, then I have a post with examples about it.\n\n**6) DOCUMENT ALL YOUR AD TESTS**\n\nI cannot emphasize how important it is to document everything that you are testing. We have separate spreadsheets for our own DTC brands and our clients. We document every single day.\n\nWe document these things daily:\n\n* Daily spend per ad channel\n* Website revenue\n* New customer revenue\n* Returning customer revenue\n* New customer purchases\n* Returning customer purchases\n* New customer CPA &amp; profit.\n* Returning customer CPA &amp; profit.\n* Contribution Margin\n* eROAS ( MER, Overall ROAS)\n* What ad concepts did we launch\n* What ad concept # is getting the most spend\n* What ad concepts that we launched last week failed\n\nThis is daily. My team documents more on a daily basis than 99% of business documents in a month. This is one of our advantages. We have clients where we have documented over 2 years of actions and tests.  Every single test is intentional, it has a whole idea behind it. It's not random.\n\nDocumentation helps us learn, improve, and adapt to this ever-changing landscape.\n\nDocument EVERYTHING. Because then you can track what is (or isn’t) performing and why over time.\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nA lot has changed over the last 4 years: OS updates + Consumer trust + Platform algorithms, + Competition have grown immensely. \n\nMeta success in 2024 &amp; 2025 isn't about secrets or hacks. It's about building trust first, and then testing, tracking, and adapting so you can find what works and double down on it.\n\nAt the end of the day, it all comes down to DOING THE BASICS AT A GREAT LEVEL.\n\nDo that, and you will win.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nSee you in the next one.",

    "title": "How to get consistency post Andromeda.",
    "selftext": "The old way of running Facebook ads is done post Andromeda. No more 3:2:2, No more 3-5 creatives per campaign. No more audiences. It’s dead. Campaigns that I’ve been running for 3-4 years for my clients have just fell off a cliff. So here’s what I’ve learned so far how to crush it post Andromeda. \n\nThis a quick read to help you crush it in Q4 and beyond.   \n\nI use 3 simple campaigns\n \nA Prospecting|A manual bidding scale| And a remarketing. \n\nProspecting\nGoal: Find new creatives. \n\nHow it’s set up:\n1 campaign, CBO on, broad targeting (no interests).\n\nStart small: ~$30/day.\nLoad it with 5–8 fresh creatives each week (new hooks, angles, formats).\n\nWhat we watch: Cost per Result (lead/sale), click-through rate, 3-7 day trend.\n\n What we do: Kill obvious losers fast, keep 2–3 winners, and keep testing. This is where we discover what works.\n\n\nRemarketing\nGoal: Warm up anyone who clicked, viewed, or hit the site but didn’t convert.\nHow it’s set up:\n1 campaign at ~20% of total daily spend.\nAudiences: site visitors, add-to-carts, video viewers (30–90 days).\nCreatives focus on trust: FAQs, objection flips, testimonials, UGC, offer clarity.\n\nWhat we watch: Cheap CPR and strong conversion rate.\n What we do: Answer doubts, show proof, restate the offer, and close.\n\nScale\nGoal: Pour budget into proven winners without breaking efficiency.\n\nHow it’s set up:\nMove only validated winners from Prospecting.\nStart ~$100–$200/day; increase 5–10% daily if CPR/ROAS holds. (I typically start this at $1,000 a day with manual Bidding. \nUse manual bid caps when needed to control CPA in hot auctions.\n\n What we watch: ROAS/CPA versus target; stability over several days.\n\n What we do: Keep it clean—no experiments here. If a winner fades, replace it with a new one from Prospecting.\n\nTo summarize the structure: \nProspecting finds the messages and creatives that pull strangers in.\n\nRemarketing convinces and reminds warm people to take action.\n\nScale multiplies only what’s already working.\n\n\nThat’s it. Keep it stupid simple now. \n\nHow to create creatives: \n\nHuman psychology never changes; It didn't change in facebook analytica, ios 14, or the 2022-present  “ad-pocalypse”. The thing that changes is how the algorithm targets your ideal persona. Pre 2022 it was lookalikes, interest based targeting ect. Now the creative is your targeting. And it's never been more important to nail this than now. \n\nLet me share an example. One of my lowest ad spend accounts is selling backpacking trips to half dome. (And we completely booked him out!)\n\nApril 1st - Jul 31st: Spend $17,463.63— ROAS 4.88 — Tracked Revenue $85,267.68\n\nWith the right creative strategy, ad spend doesn't matter, it will come naturally.\n\nOk lets go into making our “Advertising playbook.” And Lets Find the Who, the What and the Why.\n\nMarketing research is boring. You can now automate this with ChatGPT’s new feature called “deep research”. Before it would be weeks of me scrolling the internet filing up my advertising playbook. Now AI does it in like five minutes. (Just ask to find my niches, desires, painpoints, opinions, objections, competitors, language and build my avatar.)  It's never been easier, no excuse to not try right? Add the research in the first section of your playbook.\n\nWhen we do our research we need to find the Who, What, Why. We’ll put this into our playbook and this will help with angle and concept creation in a bit.\n\nWho are you talking to in your creative, in your advertising copy, in your landing page copy? This goes a lot into how Facebook now targets your potential clients. It doesn't matter how unique your offer is, or what your adspend is. If you hit this, Facebook will find people interested in your offer. It doesn’t matter how niche it is. (Just give it a few days to optimize with low budgets.)\n\nWhat problem does your offer solve for the Who And Why?\n\nWhat's the unique mechanism, or process to achieve the desire?\n\nThese two questions are called “conversion questions”. It's really focusing on pain points and desires.\n\nEx. for the backpacking company I booked out we focused: On the sights, the journey, the adventure of seeing something new. This made people book like crazy because it hit the bulls eye. Again this works for every niche because we’re using human psychology.\n\nAnd this leads us into The Creative section of the Playbook. Look at this as a way to keep track of winning angles and concepts.\n\nSo let's create some.\n\nLet's start with angles. What are some USPs of your product? And how does it help your personas problems? And what is the desired product outcome? (A USP is just marketing slang for a unique selling point.)\n\nTry desire, painpoint, case studies/testimonials, Objection flipping, Pattern-Interrupts and scroll stopping angles\n\nOk now lets do some concept mapping. (Look at a concept as a visual to communicate your angles message and an angle as psychological.)\n\nHere’s some examples of concepts: UGC, Stock video, Before/After, Static, Reviews, LTOs, Product/service outcomes ect. There's so many more.\n\nExample of concept mapping: A1-C1-C2-C3-C4-C5  A2-C1-C2-C3-C4-C5 ect.\n\nI make changes one variable at a time. Just so I can keep track of what worked and what didn't.\n\nHere’s my copywriting process when I'm making videoscripts, headlines, and body copies.\n\nThis is my simple headline formula that kills it:\n\n[Pain/Frustration] + [Big Promise/Relief] + [Hint of Speed or Simplicity]\n\nThis my go to copywriting formula for scripting video ads, body copies landing pages you name it:\n\n(Scroll stopping hook) + (Pain/Frustration) + (Flip the belief + give relief) +  (Introduce your mechanism/process) + (Drop proof/case study) + (Direct CTA)\n\nAgain you see that the playbook we’ve been creating is making the whole process a breeze.\n\nOK when we finish our concept mapping and copywriting we now go into the creation process and then into prospecting.\n\n(Ad anxiety is a real thing, I still get it just create and test!)\n\nProspecting and Remixing your winning ads.\n\nAfter creating your ads, Have a Prospecting campaign to test these per offer/product. Test 5-8 different creatives per week. Remember don't spray and pray. Quality over Quantity.\n\nWhen your ads are over performing that's when we add into a scale campaign to then start increasing the volume.\n\nWhen your ads are starting to crush it and hit key KPIs. Then mark it in your play book and now we’re remixing the ad. Basically what this is just making sure we can get the most out of a winning ad because of the hard work that it takes to create. And we just create more variations of it.\n\nKeep track of every change you make within your playbook; it'll help you optimize in the future.\n\nBut that is the way as a Facebook ad consultant how I'm able to create 10-20 ads a day.\n\nHow I scale with manual bidding: \nWhy does Manual Bidding Matter? Automatic bidding can lead to inefficiencies in competitive markets. Manual bidding allows advertisers to protect margins, ensure consistent CPAs, and maintain control over scaling. Especially during big updates that mess with the algo. \n\nUnderstanding Bid Caps:  (I’m gonna try to explain this in a more technical tone so if you’d like me to explain it in a different way lmk.). \n\nA bid cap is the maximum bid you set for a conversion. For example, if your breakeven CPA is $50, setting a cap at $45 ensures profitability while still winning auctions. \n\nWhen to Use Manual Bidding Best used when:  You know your breakeven CPR/CPA. - You have validated creatives (Min 3). - You’re scaling aggressively. Avoid when campaigns are new with little data. \n\nHow to Set Bid Caps Framework: 1. Calculate breakeven CPA. 2. Set bid 5–15% below account CPR. 3. Launch with enough budget 10-20 times your bid. 4. Raise caps gradually if delivery/volume lags. \n\nCommon Mistakes Avoid: - Caps set too low. - Scaling budgets too quickly. - Miscalculating breakeven numbers. - Expecting caps to fix bad creative/funnel. \n\nOptimization Strategies include: - Adding your winners with slightly higher caps. - Use automated rules for CPR thresholds. - Refresh creatives weekly. - Adjust caps based on performance data. Scale with Confidence. \n\nScale gradually: - Increase bid by 10–20% daily if you see little to no volume.  Monitor CPR and adjust caps to keep campaigns profitable. Your bid is the lever for budget. The higher the bid the higher the volume. \n\nManual bidding with bid caps is advanced but powerful. When combined with great creative and disciplined execution, it gives businesses predictable and scalable results.\n\nAnyways as always these long form post take me weeks to write. As a solo consultant time goes very quick. \n\nAnd real quick. I want to thank you and this community. With you sharing, liking, and commenting your questions you’re pushing these post to people that need help. \n\nI hit my goal this year to help 1,000 people and it wouldn’t be possible without you all.  \n\nI also have a book I’m writing it’s free in my bio I do need some constructive feedback on it. It’s 27 chapters and the people I’ve given it to, love it so far. \n\nAnyways cheers redditors and I’ll see you in the next post. \n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Quick Facebook Pixel Fix That Can Improve Your Facebook Ad Performance.",
    "selftext": "Hello Redditors!\n\nToday, I wanted to share a quick fix that we do for most of the ad accounts once we take over. Some clients have this fully setup, and some don't.\n\nThis fix has everything to do with Event Match Quality Rating on our events manager. You can see the rating for your pixel events. Especially for those who are in e-commerce, your main event is Purchase; you want for the rating to be as high as possible. [Click here to view the screenshot ](https://ibb.co/6JBVyd6)\n\nThe higher the score, the higher quality data you will have on your conversions, which leads to better advertising performance.\n\nHere are the exact steps with screenshots you need to do to improve your EMQ\n\nLet's start with the easiest improvement.\n\n1. Go to events manager\n2. Click Settings ([ Screenshot](https://ibb.co/Qf0qJZT))\n3. Make sure that automatic advanced matching is turned on\n4. Click Show customer information parameters\n5. Turn on all the options\n6. Make sure that Track events automatically without code is turned off ([Screenshot](https://ibb.co/JtzZ1dJ)) having this on leads to overreporting which is happening anyways and bad data on ads side.\n\nNow once the easiest improvements are done, the next step is to improve the API.\n\nHere are the steps.\n\n1. Go back to data sources.\n2. Select overview\n3. You will see your events - click on the purchase event\n4. Then click manage the event - [Screenshot ](https://ibb.co/qF9JT2T)\n5. Then click to edit conversions API - [Screenshot](https://ibb.co/VqGKm0k)\n6. Click continue - [Screenshot ](https://ibb.co/XYB21bL)\n7. Select events. Make sure you have at least the first 5 selected. [Screenshot ](https://postimg.cc/9r8nsSdP)\n8. Click Continue\n9. Select parameters\n10. Chose purchase first\n11. Select the ones I have selected in [screenshot](https://postimg.cc/QH8yVsNZ)\n12. Click Continue\n13. Review everything and click continue\n14. Click finish\n15. Repeat this process for all the events ( View content, ATC, Checkout, Add payment Info)\n\nOnce this is done, give it at least 24-48 hours, and your EMQ will improve and continue to improve.\n\nDoing this thing alone and making sure everyhing is matching up can improve your results. I'm curious on how many didn't have this fully setup. Share your purchase event match quality scores. Ours usually hovers around from 9 - 9.6. Haven't reached 9.9 or 10 yet.\n\nHopefully, this was valuable.\n\nThanks for reading. See you in the next one.",

    "title": "A simple but effective way to run facebook ads ",
    "selftext": "Hi guys! I spent about 800K on Facebook ads last year and thought I would share some insight into what works best. Especially as it is not as complex as it seems at first glance. \n\n**1. CBO TESTING**  \nWe can all agree that Facebook is rather smart. Facebook wants you to get sales so that you come back and spend even more on their ads platform. This is the foundation for this simple account structure. \n\nFor each of the big product categories you have (Tenst, Snowboards, Jacket, etc) you should have one ***CBO prospecting*** (testing) campaign. This means that you should have one CBO for all your jacket ads, one for all your snowboard ads, and one for all your jacket ads. The goal of this prospecting campaign is only to find the best-performing ads that hit certain KPIs in terms of **CPA** and/or **ROAS**. \n\nThe theory behind this is simple. As I stated in the opening, Facebook is smart, they want us to yield great results from their platform. Thus we should help Facebook optimize as best as possible. By having one CBO prospecting campaign for each category, we let each CBO campaign get data on a specific customer type. By only feeding *snowboard* creatives into the snowboard CBO, we help Facebook define a specific audience. As the Snowboard CBO gets more and more data, it is easier for Facebook to show ads to the correct audience, the snowboarders. \n\nIf we had gone the other way around and had one big prospecting CBO across all categories, we wouldn't make it easier for Facebook to target the correct audience, in fact, we make it harder. In addition to that, Facebook might find a winning creative from one adset, and give that all the spend. That means that we won't sell much from the other categories. \n\n**Why do we test in a CBO and not an ABO?**\n\nIf we test in an **ABO** we force spending to each adset, and unless we have a 100% hit ratio of good creatives inside the adsets, we are doomed to lose money, resulting in lower profit margins. But if we on the other hand do the testing in a **CBO** we allow Facebook to determine what adsets and creatives to spend on. The ones that are most likely to perform the best will get the majority of the spend. This way we avoid spending on bad-performing ads. \n\nI usually give each adset 5-7 days to get spent, and if it does not get any spend, I turn it off. If it gets spend, but with no results after a few days, I also turn it off. Once we find winners, it will be harder to get new creatives to get spend, and that is good, as we want the new creatives to be **better** than the current winners. We don't want Facebook to spend on something that is second best, we want it to spend on the best. \n\n**How to move forward?**\n\n* You should always be developing new sets of creatives. This is the biggest factor there is. If you have good creatives, you will see results, no matter the account structure. Focus on this. \n* Start with a low spend on the testing campaigns if you don't have a good budget. Typically 3x your CPA. You should not focus on scaling this campaign too hard, as you will do that in the next step. I typically let it hoover around 500-1000$, whereas the scaling campaign (next step) is where the real scaling begins. \n* If the CBO meets the KPIs, i prefer to scale it 20% every other day, and with 5-10% if the budget is already above 500$. This is different for each account, so you have to try. If the results drop, i scale it back 20. Tips: Look at the avg results for the last 3 consecutive days when measuring results and KPI goals.  \n\n  \n**2. SCALING CAMPAIGN** \n\nAfter you have found your best-performing creatives in the CBO campaigns, you want to make an **ASC** campaign for each major category (snowboards, tents, jackets, etc). You are going to take the best 10% performers from the **CBO Prospecting** campaigns and duplicate the Ad ID into the corresponding **ASC Scalig** campaign. But be aware, that if you do not have any good performers, you should not duplicate them into any campaign. The creatives you duplicate need to hit certain KPIs, which is important for you to be able to scale them. \n\n* You should not turn off any winners in the **CBO** even after you have duplicated them over to the ASC. As you want the new creatives you test to compete with the current winners. \n\nThe ASC campaign is our scaling campaign, meaning that this will be your campaign with the highest spend, given that you have found winning creatives in the first step. You should always try to feed the CBO Prospecting campaign with new adsets each week so that you can find new winners to duplicate into the ASC campaign.   \n\n\n**3. Creative testing**\n\nThis is by far the most important step of the entire post. 90% of the results come from good creatives. Compared to previous years, it's more and more important to test new creatives, new angles, and so on. We test about 5 new creative angles each week, with 4-6 variations of each angle. \n\n**Here is my creative testing guide** \n\n1. Define a desire or angle you want to test. It does not matter if it is a video ad or a static image ad. For each angle you define, you should make 4-6 variations, so that you can test all these against each other in one adset, inside the CBO testing campaign. \n2. If it's images I test the layout, the size, font colors, or just the image itself. But it is important that the angle stays the same, so you just test one variable at a time. Example: The angle is \"70% off this snowboard this week only\". To test this I would have 6 different image ads, all with the same text, just different lifestyle images of the snowboard, etc. \n3. If you test videos, you define the angle but change up the first 3 seconds **(hook)** of the video for each variation. \n4. If you find something that is working, double down on that, and squeeze the juice from that angle. Don't think it used up because you have one creative on it that works? Big mistake. \n\n\n\n**Angles that work for us right now**\n\n* 3 reasons why I love this... \n* Just found my boyfriend the perfect gift\n* My girlfriend loved this .... i got for her this holiday season \n* GIfting angles in general \n* The perfect Christmas gift \n\n  \nIf you read all, thanks! Hope this helped at least one person out :) \n\n\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "Hi Redditors,\n\nYou may have seen a few of my posts on other PPC threads where I shared some of the resources I use to manage my ads.\n\nI’ve been running ads for about 10 years and thought I’d share the process behind a small account I took over in November last year and the exact steps we took to scale this account to earn more than $45,000/mo from Meta Ads alone.\n\nHere are the results.\n\n**Before** *(Jan 1st to October 31st 2023)*\n\n* **Ad Spend:** $20,049.32\n* **Revenue**: $12,640.00\n* **ROAS**: 63%\n\nScreenshot: [https://imgur.com/a/Bg9xgP5](https://imgur.com/a/Bg9xgP5)\n\n**After** *(November 1st 2023 to August 18th 2024)*\n\n* **Ad Spend:** $60,258.94\n* **Revenue**: $241,532.05\n* **ROAS**: 401%\n\nScreenshot: [https://imgur.com/FAeS43g](https://imgur.com/FAeS43g)\n\nShopify Screenshot: [https://imgur.com/8kiLqxo](https://imgur.com/8kiLqxo)\n\nThis brand's sales increased by +1,810% while improving ROAS from 63% to 401%.\n\nIn this post, I'll share the step-by-step process so I can share what has been working for me.\n\n**Additional details about this account**\n\nThis brand sells mid-tier dive watches where most are priced between $450-$500. Break-even is at 190% ROAS.\n\nThey have around 15-20 different watches and *barely* have any traffic from different sources other than Facebook Ads — except for the occasional referrals from blogs and influencers.\n\nLet’s dive in.\n\n# 1. Marketing Fundamentals\n\nOne of the most common mistakes brands and marketers make when running ads is diving head-first into media buying tactics.\n\nIn +90% of the posts here, you’ll hear about\n\n* Different account structures/strategies.\n* Creative testing processes.\n* Bidding strategies *(cost caps vs lowest costs)*\n\nBut while these are important, they won’t make or break an account.\n\nFor this client in particular, this was 100% the case.\n\nThe previous media buyer was running creative tests, different bid strategies, different audiences… you name it.\n\nBut he didn’t consider almost anything else about the brand, and product.\n\nHere’s the thing.\n\n**When you take over a new ad account or are trying to turn performance around, 90% of your work needs to happen outside of your ad account.**\n\nIt’s that simple.\n\nIn this client’s case, **he didn’t notice that +70% of the sales came from one product variation in particular.**\n\nYet, he was still promoting every single product available in the store. To make matters worse, less than 30% of the budget was allocated to the top seller.\n\nCrazy.\n\nAs media buyers in 2024, our job is no longer to push buttons in the ads platform. We need to:\n\n1. Understand which products are worth pushing, and which ones aren’t *(what are our best sellers; which products have the highest margins; etc)*\n2. Look for patterns or seasonal trends in sales. If so, do we have a marketing calendar planned?\n3. Understand the goals we need to hit. Are we aligned with our client’s P&amp;L statement?\n4. Test different offers to make the product more enticing, effectively increasing conversion rates.\n5. Working on different funnels to reach customers in different stages of awareness.\n\nNote: if you don’t know your break-even CPA/ROAS, [you can grab my free calculator here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17V1ur8CHKMLq4hglj95i5tVxrcMT5-fvyTmI130iSis/edit?gid=245912618#gid=245912618)\n\n# 2. Our Game Plan\n\nWith that said, here’s our approach to turn this account around.\n\n1. We focused on that one particular product, exclusively.\n2. We created a limited-time offer that included a free gift in the customer’s order *(I’ll share more details about this in a minute).*\n3. We worked on our PDPs to improve the conversion rate *(added product ratings, included the logos of publications where the brand was featured to increase credibility, and made the add-to-cart button sticky).*\n\n# 3. Account Structure\n\nAs you know, in 2024 consolidation is the name of the game.\n\nWe want to keep our account as lean as possible for Facebook’s algorithm to work to its full capacity.\n\n* One ABO creative testing campaign. Every new ad concept would be tested in its own ad group, usually with 2-3 variations *(different hooks, thumbnails, headlines).*\n* One main ASC scaling campaign. Ads that were able to spend 4-5x our target CPA successfully would be scaled into this campaign using the post ID.\n\nSome additional considerations:\n\n* We only run one offer per campaign, at any given time. In this case, this meant one single product with one single offer (*special gift included)*.\n* If we wanted to scale to other countries, we would duplicate this structure: 1 creative testing campaign + 1 scaling campaign.\n\n*Note: most recently, in other accounts, I’ve been running only 1 campaign that does both testing and scaling. It’s a CBO campaign where each new ad set equals a new test and we let Facebook decide what performs better.*\n\n*Note 2: consolidation doesn’t mean you should only run one campaign, ever. To me, consolidation means making sure each offer we push has enough budget to efficiently exit the learning phase.*\n\n# 4. Ad Creative Testing\n\nThis is the same process I use to scale most of my accounts.\n\nFirst, we need to make sure that we’re 100% clear on what we’re testing, and why. To do so, we start with customer research to understand what makes a customer buy or product.\n\nWe do this research on:\n\n* Customer reviews\n* Competitor reviews\n* Amazon reviews\n* Reddit forums\n* Facebook comments\n\nOne particular angle we found repeatedly in reviews and comments was that people were buying this as a gift.\n\nThis was the main reason why we opted for a gift instead of a discount — it makes the product more appealing to buy as a gift.\n\nOther tests we decided to run:\n\n1. Using testimonials to boost social proof.\n2. Showcasing logos to highlight authority and credibility.\n3. Different styles of assets: native vs studio shots.\n4. Focusing on particular product features *(water resistance, glow-in-the-dark, different straps, etc).*\n\nWe’re not just randomly testing different visuals.\n\nIn each test we run, we want to make sure we *learn* from that test and can replicate that success consistently.\n\nMost importantly, we want to make sure that each test has enough budget to get statistical significance and allow us to draw conclusions with confidence.\n\nSince we allocated around 40% of our budget to testing, this meant we could only test around 5-6 ads per month.\n\n**It’s more important to run well-planned tests than to run hundreds of tests every month with a $5/day budget.**\n\nI use this template to keep track of our creative test results: [FACEBOOK ADS CREATIVE TESTING TRACKER TEMPLATE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V9lFV1RNv-FzD1Bgcpw7Q2oqW5_QaRESyPPJbFVuwVo/edit?gid=989727843#gid=989727843)\n\n***Note****: here's the basic math. Let's say your budget is $10,000/mo and you decide to spend 30% of your budget on creative testing. Assuming your break-even CPA is $100 then $100\\*4 = $400. $3,000/$400=7.5 creative tests you need to run per month.*\n\n*For new accounts, you want to increase the % of the budget allocated to creative testing. For more established accounts, push more towards scaling.*\n\n# 5. Scaling &amp; Optimization\n\nOnce we’ve found our winning assets, we scale slowly using both horizontal and vertical strategies.\n\n* **Horizontally**: we expand to new countries with our winning assets. As mentioned before, we simply duplicate our winning formulas into new countries. We started scaling to countries where we were already seeing a few sales and some traffic.\n* **Vertically**: we’ve been slowly increasing our budget by 10%-15% whenever needed. In this client’s case, we don’t want to scale too fast as that has caused issues with production and deliveries in the past. But usually, on other accounts, I scale every 3-5 days.\n\n# 6. Other Notes\n\nHere are a few other things you can consider when running your own account.\n\n1. **Bid strategies**: in this account, I was running mostly “highest volume”. I believe that in +90% of accounts, this should be the default bidding strategy. However, if you’re experienced and know how to set your cost caps, these can work *extremely* well.\n2. **Broad targeting**: this account ran *exclusively* on broad targeting. The previous media buyer wasted a lot of time testing new interests with poor results. If you can’t make your ads work with broad audiences, you have bigger issues than your targeting.\n3. **High-engagement ads**: over the last year, everyone has been saying “ad creative is the key” to running ads successfully. And I 100% agree. However, I see a lot of accounts that do *everything* right when it comes to research, angles, and strategy but then… forget where they’re advertising. You don’t want to come across as extremely *salesy*. Focus on creating ads that are also engaging and generate comments, reactions, and shares. Look for trends in social media and leverage them — but make sure you catch them early on. If they’ve been “trending” for a while, it’s probably a better idea to stay away.\n\nIf you need any additional resources, look at my post history and you'll see a few posts with links to free resources I commonly use.\n\nI hope this somehow helps even if only to brainstorm some new ideas or to generate a (hopefully) healthy discussion here.\n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any questions!\n\nCheers,",

    "title": "After spending 1.8M on ads here’s what I’ve learned ",
    "selftext": ".. nothing absolutely nothing.\n\nKidding.\n\nOk so you hear creative is king but what does that mean? \n\nIt means that your ads aren’t designed to sell. They are designed to get the click to your website.\n\nYour website is designed to sell.\n\nIf you are trying to go for the sale too hard in your ads this is why they are failing.\n\nNow that Meta is favouring broad your creative has to do several things.\n\n1. Identify your audience and hook them into reading the ad.\n\nDon’t use tired old marketing hooks. Speak to them like a normal human being. Be relatable and speak to the problem that your product solves.\n\n2. Now you have their attention the body of the ad should qualify and sort the wheat from the chaff. Your ad should offend some people. It doesn’t mean you deliberately try to be offensive. It means your ad copy speaks to your ideal customer as if you know their problem ( the problem your offer solves) and as a result it will offend those the offer isn’t for.\n\nExample - you’re selling a book. You want people to buy it and read it all. \n\nYour ideal customer likes to read. You want to eliminate those who don’t like reading a lot of text.\n\nSo you purposely make your ads long. Like 1,500 words long. Use storytelling techniques and take them on a journey. \n\nThe ones that aren’t your customers will say TLDR and write all kinds of troll like crap.\n\nThe ones who are your customers will read the ad and buy the book. The ad is an introduction to your writing style so it serves multiple purposes.\n\nThe purpose of an ad image is to stop the scroll not to sell.\n\nThe purpose of ad copy is to eliminate people, hook in your buyers, introduce and educate, demonstrate how you can help - get the click.\n\nThe website does the selling. \n\nThe headline and description of the ad helps to stop the scroll. I use quotes from reviews in mine.\n\nPeople buy products that ad value to their lives. Think of all the products you buy and what problems they solve.\n\nDon’t just highlight the benefits demonstrate how it solves a problem. \n\nExample - Your selling shoes. Everyone needs shoes but they can be bought anywhere. Demonstrate why your brand is unique.  \n\nWhat makes you different? Does it bring a social benefit to the wearer? Will they look smarter, cooler, etc? How does it feel? Like walking on a pillow? \n\nIf your ads are failing it might not be Meta - not just. It could be that your image, headlines and ad copy are trying too hard to get the sale. \n\nTry this, \n\n“ i said to myself why ——(insert problem) so I sought to (solve problem) and discovered (something interesting about the problem) i was doing (the action your customers are taking) but what i needed to do was (intro to the solution)\n\nSo I (intro to the solution) then I discovered (something even deeper) which led me to (the solution) \n\nYou see how that text takes people on a journey?\nThis is what you want to do in your ad copy. Take them on a roller coaster without giving away the method. The method or tool is your product. The ad alerts them to the problem and highlights the complexity of it almost making it feel like you are speaking right into the very issues they are facing.\n\nThen in your copy add in 2-3 reviews that highlight how your product solved that problem.\n\nSo in conclusion what I’ve learned from spending 1.8M on ads is that ad and website copy matters more than anything, bugs come and go, but if your ad elements are doing their jobs you can weather any Facebook storm. \n\n",

    "selftext": "# In late 2020, while the world shut down, I took a gamble and started a beauty brand in the hair care space. It took a few months to find my first winning product, but once I did, everything took off fast.\n\nAt one point, I had 20 **influencers on rotation, ran ads across Meta, TikTok, Google, and even tested Snap, while taking multiple Shopify loans** to keep up with demand. The business hit **$3.2M in four years**—and then I lost it all.\n\n# What Went Wrong?\n\nMy biggest mistake? **I ignored my margins.**\n\nI kept thinking, *one more good ad will fix everything,* but costs kept rising, and I didn’t adjust fast enough. I made three **critical** errors:\n\n**I didn’t pay myself for the first three years.** Instead, I let the business cover everything—bills, expenses, whatever I needed. By the time I finally took a salary, ad costs were so high I was just using it to keep the business afloat.\n\n**I hired a 3PL too soon.** I underestimated how much it would cut into my margins before my volume justified it.\n\n**I over-relied on paid ads.** I didn’t build my community early enough to reduce my dependency on ad spend.\n\n# What I’d Do Differently Now\n\n**Pay myself from the start** – Even a small salary forces better financial discipline.  \n**Know my numbers cold** – Profit margins, breakeven points, and ad performance would dictate every move.  \n**Maximize retention &amp; community early** – Focus on increasing LTV and organic sales to offset ad spend.  \n **Scale smarter, not just bigger** – Growth isn’t about chasing the highest revenue; it’s about keeping cash flow positive.\n\n# Proof That I’ve Been in the Trenches\n\nI didn’t take screenshots back then—because honestly, I didn’t think I’d ever need to prove it. Now, **Meta has wiped 2 years of my data, and I lost access to my Shopify dashboard.**\n\nBut what I *do* have left are pieces of my **Meta, Google, and TikTok ad spend history** [https://imgur.com/a/EJAnmHv](https://imgur.com/a/EJAnmHv)**, showing over $400K spent (and that’s not even the full picture).**\n\n# Why Am I Sharing This?\n\nBecause I know how lonely and confusing this journey can be. If I can help someone skip the mistakes I made, that’s worth it to me.",

    "title": "The Basics of Meta Ads CBO Optimization (Save this for later)",
    "selftext": "What's up everyone! I wanted to drop in a share some technical knowledge so you can be better equipped at optimizing your CBO campaigns. I optimize CBO campaigns across many ad accounts every day. These are the techniques that work for me consistently. I have included a video walking through my thought process optimizing a live CBO as well.\n\nCBO optimization is a blend of art and science. I tried my best to distill all the nuances in this post. I believe beginner and advanced Meta advertisers will benefit from reading this. Let's get into it!\n\n# For those of you that don't already know...\n\nWhat's a CBO? It's a setting at the campaign level that used to be called \"Campaign Budget Optimization.\" It's since been renamed to \"Advantage Campaign Budget\" but it's still commonly referred to as a CBO. How does it work?\n\nSo let's say you have 1 campaign with 4 ad sets inside. If you have CBO enabled you are setting the budget at the campaign level ($200/day for example) and letting Meta's algorithm decide how that $200 is spent amongst the 4 ad sets.\n\nIf you don't have CBO enabled, then the campaign is commonly referred to as an ABO or \"Ad Set Budget Optimization.\" This means you set the budgets at the ad set level for each of the 4 ad sets. So you could do $50, $50, $50, and $50.\n\nThe big difference here is how these two campaigns distribute their spend among the ad sets. With an ABO, Meta will spend whatever you set as a daily budget at the ad set level. Pretty simple.\n\nCBOs can be a little more tricky, especially for beginners. Not all ad sets will spend evenly. Meta's algorithm will attempt to skew the spend towards what it thinks will get you the most conversions (or whatever you are optimizing for).\n\n&gt;Meta's algorithm doesn't always get it right though. It might start spending more towards something that is giving you bad results. ***That's where we step in.***\n\n# First, make sure you set up the CBO for success.\n\n* All ad sets should have the same ads inside, so it's an apples to apples comparison of audiences.\n* Audience sizes should be similar because Meta's algorithm tends to skew spend towards the larger audiences if they are drastically different. My rule of thumb is to keep them all generally the same size.\n* I try to set my daily campaign budget in such a way that I can reasonably expect to get 1-2 sales per ad set per day minimum. I base my math off of my average cost per purchase for whatever product/service I am advertising.\n   * For example: Let's say I have a historical average cost per purchase of $25. If I set my daily budget to $200/day and I have 4 ad sets, then I can reasonably expect each ad set to get roughly 2 sales per day if all the ad sets were to spend equally. (We know it won't.)\n* If you want to work with a 'fast paced CBO' give a bigger daily budget or do less ad sets so each one gets more daily budget. If you want to move a slower pace, give less daily budget or do more ad sets.\n\n# Next, let the campaign run for ~48 hours. I normally let them run for 2 full days and then start optimizing (if needed) on the 3rd morning.\n\n* Keep in mind that CBOs are very dynamic. Touching an ad set within a CBO can (and most likely will) affect the other ad sets in the CBO. CBOs can sometimes be super delicate in some ad accounts while others are more resistant to changes.  You have to see how your ad account behaves.\n* I prefer to do all my CBO optimization at the ad set level. Optimizing at the ad level can be problematic because it can have a cascading affect on the rest of the ad sets in the CBO. Turning off an ad could change the way Meta spends towards that ad set, which in turn affects how the other ad sets spend as well.\n\n# Now it's the 3rd morning. Here's what you do:\n\n* Look at the maximum results and sort by amount spent. What we are looking for is that your top spender has the best results in terms of lowest CPA or highest ROAS or however you measure success. Sometimes it works out where Meta's algorithm does a great job and diverts the spend to the best performing ad set. We aren't always that lucky though.\n\n# Hypothetical Example ($200/day, 4 ad sets, Avg CPA of $25)\n\n* Let's say theres 4 ad sets, the #1 spender has bad results, the #2 spender has good results, #3 has good results and #4 not enough spend to determine. Well in this case, we might want to close #1 so it liberates the spend and gives budget to #2, #3 and #4. But there's more to consider.\n* When you decide to close an ad set in a CBO, know that the ad set that you closed will liberate the budget to the remaining ad sets. If the amount that is liberated is large, you can consider that like you are scaling the remaining ad sets. To know roughly how much will be liberated, look at what the ad set in question spent yesterday.\n* **Example:** Let's say the spends looked like this yesterday:\n   * \\#1 spent $130 (bad results)\n   * \\#2 spent $35 (good results)\n   * \\#3 spent $30 (good results)\n   * \\#4 spent $5 (not enough to determine)\n* If you turn off #1, it will liberate $130 to the remaining 3 ad sets. If you divide $130 by 3, that's like you are theoretically scaling each ad set by \\~$43 if they were to spend evenly. Since we know our average cost per purchase is $25, we know that if we didn't adjust the CBO budget down at all we may expect 1-2 *additional* sales per ad set per day. That could be fine, but is also could throw off the balance of the CBO if the 'scale' was too large. If you want to maintain the balance of the CBO or 'keep it where it is' do this: after you close the ad set(s), lower the campaign budget by the amount that the ad set(s) spent yesterday. So in this case, I would lower it by around \\~$130. Now the remaining ad sets are not receiving much additional spend so they are likely to maintain similar performance.\n\n# But wait, there's more!\n\n* Since we know CBO's can be delicate, and touching it at all could potentially ruin it, I follow this rule of thumb when optimizing: **Try to make the biggest positive impact in the least amount of moves.** Ask yourself if the optimization you are consider is worth the risk of potentially ruining the whole campaign. If the reward outweighs the risk, go for it. But how do you know if the risk is worth it?\n* Take a look at your ad sets. Put a checkmark next to the ones that you want to keep (leave the ones you don't unchecked). Take a look at the average ROAS and/or CPA. Now click on the search bar at the top then click filter by row selection. Now look at the average ROAS/CPA. That is the 'theoretical change' that you would be making. If the improvement seems worth it to you to potentially ruin the campaign, then go for it. I explain this in the video below. Make sure to keep an eye on the average results. \n* I like to walk through each day to see how Meta is spending towards each ad set. I continually monitor this because it can change. If your top spender has the best performance, perfect....but don't get too comfortable. Keep an eye on how the other ad sets are spending. Sometimes other ad sets with worse performance can try to compete for spend and even overtake the winner. If you notice this 'bad behavior' you need to turn off those ad sets before it ruins your whole campaign.\n* Once you make a decision, make sure to stand by it and give it enough time to be sure of its results. Being observant in your ad account and picking up on your ad account's particular patterns is super valuable. After time you will be able to anticipate the way your CBOs will react to your changes.\n* If the optimization fails, don't be discouraged. Close the campaign and try again.\n* I don't think there is a single 'correct' way to optimize a CBO. How you decide to optimize it entirely depends on your character, risk tolerance and situation. The techniques I shared are for you to use at your discretion. Take what works, leave what doesn't.\n* CBO optimization can take months if not years of consistent practice to master in my opinion. There are so many different situations that arise. Each CBO is like a brand new puzzle to figure out. It can be really satisfying when you make the 'right' move and it optimizes perfectly. \\*chefs kiss\\*\n\n&gt;**Here is a real world example of a CBO that I am optimizing right now. It is a Crazy Method campaign which is a CBO with multiple ad sets duplicated inside. All the normal CBO optimization principles apply here. Follow my thought process:** [**https://youtu.be/k1zkgHdRSz8**](https://youtu.be/k1zkgHdRSz8)\n\nI hope you found this post helpful.

    "title": "I've Audited 100+ Facebook Ad Accounts This Year. Here Are 3 Money-Burning Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)",
    "selftext": "Hey good people of r/FacebookAds! For my cake day I want to share some Facebook ads mistakes that I keep seeing in ad accounts audits that are just scorching money yet are super simple to fix.\n\n\n\n# No System for Testing\n\nI see far too many businesses simply throwing shit at the wall and hoping it sticks. This method quickly turns Facebook ads into gambling at the casino. The house always wins. Systematizing your testing helps you find winning ads much faster and more reliably.\n\n**Only Change 1 Variable At A Time**\n\nLet’s say you have 1 campaign that’s doing OK. You launch a new campaign with a different audience, new creative and new copy. The new campaign does amazing. What made the impact? It’s very hard to tell, therefore hard to replicate. \n\nLet’s say instead you only changed the creative and everything else remained the same and the results were much better than the original campaign. Then you can be pretty confident that the creative was what made the impact. \n\nThis strategy leaves little doubt on what improved or degraded performance.\n\n**Apples to Apples Comparisons**\n\nMeta does not treat all creative types equally. What I have noticed is that Meta’s algorithm tends to prioritize spend towards dynamic catalogs first, then videos, then carousels, then single static images. If you test various creative ‘types’ in one campaign, it will generally skew spend accordingly and may not give certain creatives enough spend to judge them. If you want an apples to apples comparison of different creative, group images with images and videos with videos. This will give you a more ‘fair’ assessment of each creative. \n\n**Using ‘Constants’**\n\nLet’s say advantage shopping campaigns (ASC+) work for you consistently. Then that’s your constant and you can test various creatives against that. See which creatives are giving you the highest ROAS, lowest cost per result, or whatever metric you use to measure success. *Side note:* ASC+ tends to skew spend towards 1-3 creatives so if you notice there are some other creatives that are getting sales but not a lot of spend you can duplicate the ASC+ and exclude the creatives that took all the spend in the previous and force it to test the others.\n\nLet’s say no matter the audience you select, a certain creative always does well. Well now that’s your constant. You can use that to test various audiences like ASC+, Manual Broad, Original Audience Options, Interests, Lookalikes, Etc to see what gives you the best results. I see many people saying that audience targeting does not matter but using this strategy it is very easy to see what audiences are giving you the best cost per result and lowest CPMs.  In some ad accounts Broad gives the best results, lowest CPMs, etc. In other accounts, Broad is terrible and doesn’t work at all while more narrow audiences like interests or lookalikes give good results and significantly lower CPMs.\n\n\n\n**Label things clearly**\n\nAd accounts with no system for labeling become a mess, fast. If you label every campaign, ad set and ad clearly - you will be able to easily assess the data. If you can easily assess the data then you can make decisions based on the data much more efficiently. \n\nI tend to name campaigns and ad sets by the settings I selected. Here is an example of a campaign structure labeled effectively. It’s a 1 CBO with 1 ad set and 2 video ads.\n\n* September 12 | CBO | Adv+ Broad | Top 2 Videos\n   * Adv+ | 18-65+ | Men | Adv+ Placements\n      * Video | Woman Actor | UGC Testimonial | I Can’t Get Enough of X Hook\n      * Video | Man Actor | UGC | I Did X So You Don’t Have to\n\nThis strategy definitely saves time. And time is money so…\n\n  \n\n\n# Traffic, Awareness, Engagement...Oh My!\n\nAsk and you shall receive. Meta is going to give you exactly what you ask of it - traffic. That doesn’t mean it has to be good traffic. Don’t be fooled by impressive vanity metrics like a super low cost per click, low CPM or high CTR. If it’s not getting sales, it’s most likely driving up your expenses with not much to show for it. \n\nAwareness campaigns are pretty similar. They are going to get your ad out in front of as many people as humanly possible but generally don’t lead to many sales or conversions. Some argue that it helps get your brand out there and can help improve performance on other campaigns - however my biggest gripe is how difficult it is to objectively measure the results of an awareness campaign.\n\nEngagements campaigns can get you likes and comments but again the traffic is generally very low quality. Run a low budget Facebook page like campaign and see who is liking your page. The results may surprise you. I have seen engagement ads work to some degree for driving DMs and calls but I see Leads campaigns outperform engagement most of the time. Some argue that engagement campaigns can supplement existing sales ads with the same PostID but again its impact is not easily measurable. Last, I feel like engagement ads tend to incentivize advertisers to focus on metrics that ultimately don’t pay the bills like number of views, comments, likes etc. \n\nAll this being said, I also believe there are no absolutes with Meta ads. Are there traffic campaigns out there that crush? Absolutely. Are they few and far between? I believe so. If I see a traffic, awareness or engagement campaign that is profitable I won’t turn it off just because I don’t ‘like’ them. Be pragmatic. Keep what works, ditch what doesn’t.\n\nAt the end of the day, businesses need sales and more importantly profit to thrive. Sales and Leads campaigns are most effective for doing just that. Profit over everything.\n\n\n\n# Campaigns Set Up for Failure\n\nLet’s say that your average cost per purchase is $50 and you consider that ‘good.’ What I often see are businesses running CBO’s with 10 ad sets, several creative in each and a campaign budget at $50/day. With this setup, it’s likely going to take \\~10+ days for each ad set to get a sale. The budget is spread way too thin. Facebook ad campaigns need conversion data to optimize. If you only give an ad set $5/day with an average cost per purchase of $50, it’s generally not going to optimize well. My rule of thumb is to set up my campaigns in such a way that I should expect to get at least 1-2 sales per day per ad set. \n\nA better way to set this up would be a CBO with 1 ad set and a campaign budget of $50-100. Now I can be confident that I should in theory get at least 1-2 sales per day. Let’s say I go 4 days with no sales. Well I can be confident that this campaign is not going to work and I can close it and try something else. If I see 1-2+ sales per day, then I know I am on the right track. \n\nNext time you set up a campaign, ask yourself if you are asking ‘too much’ of Facebook. Am I spreading the budget too thin?\n\nThanks for reading. If you found this helpful, please share it with someone who could benefit from it. Leave questions and comments below, I will respond to all of them. Cheers!",

    "selftext": "To every founder, media buyer, agency owner, and e-commerce operator who’s been grinding nonstop, trying to make sense of what’s happening:\n\nYou’re not crazy. You’re not alone. And this isn’t your fault.\n\n**The truth is hard to admit, but it needs to be said: Meta ads are no longer delivering what they promise.**\n\nWe’ve all seen it. Campaigns that used to scale with precision are now falling apart overnight. Ad sets that worked for months suddenly die without warning. Targeting is incoherent. Results are erratic. Budgets vanish into thin air with nothing to show. And when you try to reach support, you’re met with useless canned replies.\n\n* The recent updates? They made everything worse.\n* The outages? Frequent, unexplained, and costly.\n* The algorithm? Unstable. Unpredictable. Untrustworthy.\n\nAnd yet we keep spending. Hoping it’ll get better.\n\nHoping the machine just needs a few more days to “reset.”\n\nThis ends now.\n\n**I’m calling for a collective pause. Stop all Meta ad spend until October 31st. Not out of spite but out of strength.**\n\nBecause continuing to feed a broken system doesn’t make you resilient. It makes you complicit.\n\nThis is not a boycott. This is a wake-up call.\n\nTo Meta: Fix your platform. Respect your advertisers. This ecosystem built with our dollars, our creativity, and our trust. And we refuse to be ignored.\n\nTo each other: We are not powerless. We are stronger than this.\n\nIf thousands of us pause spend even for just two weeks, We will be heard.\n\nAnd we’ll finally stop blaming ourselves for a problem that was never in our control.\n\n**So Until October 31:**\n\n* No Meta ad spend.\n* No campaigns.\n* No more money into the void.\n\nUse this time to reset. Rebuild. Reallocate.\n\nFocus on what does work: email. SEO. Content. Community. Organic.\n\nWe’ve given enough.\n\n**If this post resonates with you share it. Repost it. Talk about it. Don’t stay silent.**\n\nLet’s stop burning money just because we’re afraid to stop.\n\nLet’s stop pretending this is fine.\n\nLet’s make it clear: We will not fund the dysfunction.\n\n**This is our stand. Together.**",

    "selftext": "So yeah… I basically set $120,000 on fire because I forgot to hit \"pause.\"\n\nAbout a year ago, I was working as a digital marketing coordinator for a mid-size e-commerce company. Not some giant corporation—just a well-known niche brand that did decent numbers. One of my main responsibilities was managing our Fcaebook Ads campaigns. Nothing crazy, just weekly optimization, making sure budgets were under control, tweaking bids, etc.\n\nWell, our company was getting ready for a big seasonal campaign. We had everything lined up—video ads, display banners, some influencer stuff. I helped prep the Google Ads side, setting up the campaign to go live at midnight on a Friday. It was set to run for exactly 72 hours with a capped budget.\n\nHere's the thing: we also had a *test* version of the campaign that we used for approvals with the higher-ups. Same audiences, same visuals, but zero targeting filters and a dummy budget of like $50 just so we could show performance flow. That test campaign? It was *never* supposed to go live.\n\nGuess who forgot to pause the test campaign?\n\nFriday comes, everything launches. I'm feeling good. Boss is happy, ads look clean, ROAS is solid. Then Monday hits and our finance guy pings me like, “Hey, why are there *two* campaigns charging spend?”\n\nI check Facebook Ads… and my stomach drops. The test campaign didn’t just go live—it blew through our uncapped budget with *no* geo-targeting. That thing was serving ads to everyone and their grandma across the globe. It ran wide open for three straight days and racked up *$120,482.76* in ad spend.\n\nAnd the worst part? ZERO conversions. Like, we didn’t get a *single* sale from it. Just bot clicks and totally irrelevant traffic.\n\nI had to walk into the CEO’s office and explain how I’d lit a small house’s worth of money on fire because I forgot to click one stupid checkbox. To his credit, he didn’t yell. He just stared at me and said, “Well… that’s one way to learn.”\n\nI didn’t get fired. Somehow. I think it’s because I owned up to it immediately and started working on process fixes to make sure it never happened again.\n\nBut to this day, every time I open Facebook Ads, my eye twitches a little. Double check your campaigns, people. And triple check your budgets.",

    "title": "I think you have to train Facebook to give you good performance- they will take from you if you allow them.",
    "selftext": "I'm a little spender, so take my words with a grain of salt. Spent about $100k in 15 months.\n\nHowever, I've noticed one consistent behavior with Facebook. \n\nHave you guys ever turned off a campaign or ad, and almost immediately or within 1-2 hours, you make a sale or gain a bunch of engagement on the campaign/ads you JUST turned off?\n\nIn my opinion, this is because Facebook is knowingly throttling your campaigns JUST enough- to get you to keep spending, and not turning campaigns off. To me, them \"giving\" me sales as soon as I turn a campaign off, shows me that are purposefully withholding them.\n\nIf you allow them, they will raise your CPCs and your CPAs. What do I mean by allow them? I mean, if you \"test\" too often and spend too much, waiting or hoping in better performance.\n\nAfter spending $100k. I have a pretty solid idea on if a campaign or ad is heading in the right direction within the first $50 of ad spend. Typically less than that even. I know my market for my business very well.\n\nFor awhile, I got into the habit of \"testing\" way too long, and I think FB got comfortable taking money from me, since I allowed them. Then, as they raised my CPAs and CPCs, I thought something was wrong with ME or my ads.\n\nEven though deep down I KNEW what a performing ad looked like, I would convince myself to continue to spend $100-300 dollars before canning it, because so many guru's suggest so.\n\nHere's the thing, Metas algorithm is really fucking good now. Like really good. I have no doubt (unless you are a brand new account), that Facebook can't direct your ad to the right audience within the first $10.\n\nFor me, I had to realize that I know more about my ads than I think I do, and if an ad isn't performing, it's not because Facebook is still \"finding the audience\" after $100+ dollars. Facebook literally just thinks a low CPA and high CPC is what I wanted- so they gave me it.\n\nOver the past month, I decided to start being far more strict in how I run my ads. Shorter testing, and turning off campaigns and ads at the drop of a hat if they do not perform how I want. Then, even restarting them 2-3 times until they do.\n\nFor example, I had a campaign I started, that after $20 was getting $4 CPCs. That is utterly ridiculous and inacceptable. Never have I dealt with that. Something is wrong. Immediately I turned it off and restarted it, it jumped to 1.08 CPC and it kept that way all last month. Most guru's would say \"$20?! Thats far too little to knoe if an ad is going to perform. I say BS.\"\n\nThis happened multiple times this past month with multiple campaigns. WHY? Because I got into the habit of ALLOWING facebook to spend $100-200 on an ad with $3+ CPC, and Facebook thought thats what I wanted because I kept spending. In reality, I was just trying to givr the algorithm a \"fair shake,\" because that's what I've been trained to do. \n\nThis also works when raising or dropping budget. Usually, if a campaign does well for 3-7 days, I'll \"reward\" facebook by upping budget by 20%. Sometimes, this results in a huge boost of sales. If it goes bad for any longer than 2 days, I start by \"punishing\" FB and dropping budget 20%. It usually recovers almost instantly, funny how that works? If it still doesn't recover after another 24 hours. I cut it completely, and possibly restart, where it then goes back to normal.\n\nSo my advice? Be aggressive, be confident in the results you think you should be getting, and cut campaigns as soon as something feels off. I will restart a campaign max 3 times before I decide okay, maybe the algo is telling me something and these ads just suck.\n\n",

This is a feel for the auction ex. $30 doesn’t get volume.. put it on $40 and the volume spikes. \n\nLower to $35 and work your way up a dollar at a time. First 7-14 days are volatile but after that it’s the most consistent campaign to run.\n \n\nFor budget I recommend starting at $500-$1,000 maximum . But minimum $250\n\n\nYou need 50-100 sales conversions before starting this campaign type don’t use this without any data. \n\nWhen scaling you can increase budget verily rapidly 5-10% a day conservatively or $250-$500 every 3 days aggressively. You go out of learning pretty fast with this campaign strategy. Anyways crush it in Q1. ",

    "selftext": "All of my highest-converting Facebook ads follow the same core strategies, and I’ve been using them since 2021 to scale brands from around $10k/month to well past $50k. In this post, I’ll break down the foundational strategies I use every time I have been able to successfully scale a Facebook ad account.\n\nI cannot take a copy-and-paste approach with ad copy, targeting etc. because I don’t work with competing brands in the same niche. Running ads for two similar brands selling in the same countries leads to my own ads directly competing with one another.\n\nThat’s why I focus on strategy over tactics. The high-level approach remains the same, but the specifics change depending on the brand.\n\nWith that in mind, I’m going to share my proven strategies for running profitable Facebook ads, rather than one-size-fits-all tactics that might not work for your business. Hope you get something useful out of it that you can apply to your own campaigns.\n\nIf you’re curious to see results I’ve produced for clients you can see that in this album here -[ https://imgur.com/a/bruteve-facebook-campaign-results-xBNCJog](https://imgur.com/a/bruteve-facebook-campaign-results-xBNCJog)\n\nThese strategies are in no particular order, just whatever came to mind first as I was putting this list together, so feel free to skip around and only read sections that you believe are relevant to you.\n\n# Start With Expensive High-Quality Targeting (No “Warming Up” the Pixel)\n\nFar too often I speak with business owners who hear from a YouTube tutorial video that they need to “warm up” a fresh Facebook pixel with cheap traffic or page likes before jumping into conversions. I don’t recommend that at all, especially for brands already at $10k/month. Odds are you have genuine sales data on your pixel, which is infinitely more valuable to Facebook’s algorithm than random clicks or low-intent followers, and from my experience a lot of them are just straight up bots or fake accounts. Think of it like this: filling your funnel with low-quality traffic is the same as loading it up with dirt; sure, it’s “stuff,” but it won’t help you build a foundation for profitable growth. Meanwhile, truly high-quality traffic is like a pile of diamonds, Facebook can analyze those buyer signals and find more people who actually convert, not just window-shop.\n\nBy letting your pixel focus on valuable actions right away, you establish a healthy baseline that has a positive impact on all of your future campaigns. If you try to game the system with low-quality data, you risk confusing Facebook, slowing your long-term momentum, and potentially attracting the wrong audience for months. I’d rather go straight into a purchase-optimized campaign, letting the algorithm gather high-intent data from the start. This way, every retargeting or scaling move you make is built on solid ground. Diamonds, not dirt.\n\nSometimes business owners are hesitant to do this long-term with their Facebook ads at the beginning because they see that the cost per link click is very high. They let the campaigns run for a few days and turn them off because of this. Maybe it’s like $3 a click when their traffic campaigns get clicks for $0.30. They’re happy to get hundreds of people to their website not realizing that none of them will become a customer when they are hesitant to spend the same amount of money to get only a dozen.\n\nTo use an IRL example, if you owned a physical shoe store having 100 people come from the traffic campaigns would be like letting 100 people into your store who forgot their wallet at home.\n\n# Ad Account Diversification\n\nWhen I am working with a new client, I’ll usually start with maybe two or three campaigns at a daily ad spend of $100 to $150 per day which is typically enough to get a solid read on performance. But once I help a client scale toward $500/day or more, I don’t just dump more money into the same campaigns. Instead, I use that increase in ad spend as an opportunity to diversify. Mixing multiple campaign types, like cold (interest or Advantage+), retargeting, and sometimes manual-bid. This helps you be able to have backup plans when Facebook acts weird and a certain campaign type stops performing well.\n\nThis strategy has saved me countless times in those instances of weird activity in performance with Facebook ads. If one campaign suddenly tanks or a client’s top-selling product goes out of stock, I can simply pause that campaign and still keep revenue flowing from the others. With Facebook’s algorithm constantly shifting, an ad account with three, four, or even five diverse campaigns has a better chance of remaining profitable through ups and downs.\n\n# Early On, Find the Highest Quality Cold Traffic Source\n\nOne of the first things I want to do in new ad accounts is see whether interest targeting or Advantage+ gives us higher quality cold traffic. In the past, I made the mistake of sticking too long with interest targeting and constantly testing different interests for mediocre results, then to realize a few weeks in that launching an Advantage+ campaign and it outperforms all of the interest targeting by a lot. These days, I don’t let weeks go by before giving Advantage+ (or whatever cold targeting method I’m curious about) a fair shot.\n\nIf both interest targeting and Advantage+ work well, I keep them running simultaneously for diversification. This is something that I see happen sometimes, but the vast majority of the time, one of them heavily outperforms the other by so much that it only makes sense to use one. By finding that winner early, you’ll build a stronger foundation for future campaigns and be in a much better position to optimize and scale.\n\n# Adapting to Ad Account Behavior Shifts\n\nAfter managing a Facebook ad account for four or five months, you often see noticeable shifts in performance. One month, interest targeting might be your top performer then, out of nowhere, all of your interest targeting campaigns stop working. Or maybe Advantage+ was the best campaign type, but suddenly the CPC spikes and conversions drop. These shifts may seem random, but in my experience, it’s just how Facebook’s algorithm “reshuffles the deck” every so often.\n\nI manage this one ad account where one time catalog sales campaigns were crushing it for the first three months of last year, consistently at 4x to 5x ROAS. Then in the fourth month, results took an abrupt nosedive even after trying my go-to tactics to save a declining campaign. Instead of trying to force that campaign type to work again, I paused the catalog sales campaigns and shifted budget to our Advantage+ campaign that was working better. Within a week or two, we’d recouped our lost revenue and even found a higher overall ROAS.\n\nThis flexibility is exactly why I push for diversification. If I’ve been running a video ads campaign and a catalog sales campaign side by side, then I can quickly divert resources when one starts declining in performance. Same goes for retargeting, if the frequency skyrockets and the results decline, I’ll shift more ad spend towards the higher performing cold campaigns. By keeping multiple campaigns and targeting methods in play, you can easily pivot when one campaign or ad type stops performing well.\n\n# Retargeting Right Away\n\nSomething I see often is people will wait a couple of weeks before launching any retargeting campaign with the thought process of “we need to grow our custom audiences bigger first, then we can retarget.” When I build campaigns for new clients, I always retarget from day one no matter how little existing data the account has in their custom audiences. Realize that even with brand new ad accounts, when you launch cold campaigns you’re still generating a steady stream of mini “touch points” right away. For instance, if you’re using video ads, you’re adding people into a 3-second video views audience almost instantly, and the same goes for page engagement. The range of cost for 3-second video views varies mostly depending on CPM for that industry, but I’ve seen $50 in ad spend towards a cold campaign generate hundreds of 3 second video views in one day.\n\nI usually keep retargeting daily ad spend low in the beginning, maybe $10 to $30 per day depending on the total daily budget so that we don’t exhaust the custom audiences too fast with too high of ad spend towards retargeting.\n\n# Discover Creatives That Never Stop Working\n\nA common assumption is, “All creatives eventually burn out.” In reality, I’ve managed ad accounts for years where a few standout video ads continue to work years later. I may occasionally refresh the campaign structure or do a new campaign setup but the creative itself remains profitable. I call them “old faithful” creatives because they just always work.\n\nHere’s something that I don’t see a lot of people talk about: new potential customers enter your market all the time. I believe this is part of the reason how creatives can last long term. Let me give you an example. Picture someone who’s never worn a high-end watch before because they prefer a smartwatch. Now imagine that same person a few months later: maybe they’ve got weddings to attend or they’ve been hanging out with friends who are into fancy watches. Suddenly, that watch creative you’ve been running for months speaks to them in a way it never could before. Your ad doesn’t have a “use by” date if it’s genuinely resonating.\n\nOf course, not every creative will work forever and some truly do fatigue, especially if your frequency skyrockets and you keep hitting the same people. But when you find that winning creative that consistently converts almost all the time, there’s no need to retire it just because it’s been around for a while and you see a sudden drop in performance on it in one campaign. Relaunch the campaign but keep the creative that’s performing in it. As long as new people are seeing the ad and your brand message is still relevant it can keep pulling in results far longer than most people realize.\n\nIt is easier said than done to just “make really good creatives” but this strategy is more about finding an old faithful creative because it can also be good to use for very advanced campaign structures and off the wall tactics. \n\n# Using Relevant Brand Tone to Shape Ad Copy &amp; Creatives\n\nWhenever I manage campaigns for two vastly different types of brands, I know that a one-size-fits-all “fill-in-the-blank” video ad script or ad copy template won’t work for both. This is mainly due to the tone that fits each brand. For example, a high-end brand might focus on elegance or other premium factors whereas a casual or playful brand might use bold, bright visuals with short, punchy text and emojis, highlighting fun or affordability instead of prestige.\n\nA situation I’ve been in a few times with is people inquiring with me to make ads for them and asking to see ad copy or videos I’ve made for other brands and me having to preface with letting them know that if I were to write copy or videos for their brand it would be different in terms of tone. Sometimes I’ll just tell them bluntly “it's almost a waste of time for you to look at the ads I’ve made for other clients since yours will look much different” and instead we’ll just have a conversation about their brand and I’ll give them a general idea of the tone and angle that would be used.\n\nI’ve worked with many types of brand tone and I have not worked with a brand that does an overhaul of branding which would require a shift in the tone. So for my situation, with the brands I’ve worked with long-term they all have remained the same in terms of branding and when I write new ads or video scripts I am always able to use the brand tone elements as the foundation.\n\n# Customer Buying Behavior to Guide in Retargeting Changes\n\nI’ve seen a lot of people recommend strict percentages of cold targeting to retargeting for everybody, like 80% cold traffic and 20% retargeting. While that may be a decent starting point, I always tailor my approach once I see how an audience actually behaves in terms of their buying behavior. If the product is high-ticket or caters to a more cautious buyer, you might need a heavier retargeting push. In those cases, I’ll often scale my retargeting budget beyond my usual “default” because people need multiple touches (and more in-depth reminders) before they feel ready to purchase.\n\nIn contrast I’ve worked with brands where the item is super affordable and impulse-friendly, so the audience makes their buying decision from seeing just 1 ad. For them, retargeting can be minimal or even nonexistent because the initial cold ads already convert enough to remain profitable.\n\n# Use Data to Guide Our Decisions for Potential Tests to Run\n\nIt’s one thing to brainstorm a completely random test like launching a lookalike campaign or going “Instagram-only” but it’s far better when the numbers actually support the theory that such a test could be successful. Don’t just say, “I feel like trying lookalikes… because why not”; do it because the data shows real potential. For example, if data shows that the majority of conversions come from Instagram on mobile devices, that’s your sign to run an Instagram-only campaign and see if it improves results. Or if you notice retargeting is performing well and at a high ROAS but the frequency is still low, that’s a clear signal you can expand retargeting without burning out the same audience.\n\nI’ve seen so many ad accounts where people decide on new tests purely on hunches: “Let’s try advantage+.” “Why not run a broad campaign?” You can do that, but it’s more of a shot in the dark. I prefer to start from an actual data point that points to a potential winning test. In short, I let the metrics guide me.\n\nSometimes I’ll have conversations with a client that will throw out a random idea to test that they’ve heard or seen work for others and I’m typically hesitant to launch it because I don’t see data supporting that specific idea. I’m always honest with them about it letting them know that there is a low probability of it working. Sometimes they go with my recommendation to try something else, and sometimes the hunch within them is too strong to ignore.\n\nThat’s not to say you should never experiment. Data-driven tests are still experiments but they’re guided by real data instead of wild guesses.\n\n# Analyzing Data Over 5 to 7 Days Instead of the Day to Day\n\nI often see people look at their Facebook Ads dashboard on a daily and usually hourly basis and make big decisions the moment they spot a sign of a campaign not performing well for the day. One step better that I see at times as well is if something doesn’t look good after 2 days they turn it off. Both options are too reactive in my experience and it isn’t enough data to make big decisions.\n\nDay-to-day fluctuations, especially in newer or smaller-budget campaigns, can be incredibly misleading. Usually the algorithm just needs another day or two to properly optimize. By focusing on a more substantial 5 to 7 days before making big changes, you’re giving your campaigns time to find their footing and stabilize.\n\nAnother common scenario: ads start strong on the first day, then drop a bit the next. If you prematurely pause them, you might miss a potential winner. I look for a general upward or at least stable trend over that 5 to 7 day span and compare it to the previous 5 to 7 days. If performance keeps inching upward or holds steady above KPI, that’s usually my green light to start scaling that up. If results nosedive continuously and never recover during that timeframe, it’s a sign the campaign might need major adjustments or a complete overhaul. Essentially, patience often pays off and I always give my campaigns a fair shot before making big changes.\n\nAnd that’s it.\n\nAll of these strategies have consistently delivered results for the top-performing ad accounts I’ve managed. I hope you found these insights valuable, and I wish you the best of luck as you apply them to your own campaigns. Thanks for reading!",

    "selftext": "Hello Reddit,\n\nTL;DR Discovered a smart way to scale Meta ad spend from $10k to $100k+ daily using the 'reach' metric in Facebook's Ad Library API for EU ads. Made a tool for you guys to use for free.\n\nI was part of a marketing team, we were  knee-deep in Meta ads, which made up 80% of our marketing channels and we were struggling big time. We worked with D2C brands, both digital and ecomm, but nothing seemed to work. New ads were flopping and the old ones were burning out fast. We tried copying competitors ads but couldn't replicate their success. It was fustrating, and team morale was hitting rock bottom. I kept asking myself - why are they crushing it while we're stuck? \n\nOne day accidently I stumbled upon the 'reach' metric in Facebook's Ad Library for EU ads (due to GDPR regulations). Nothing impressive at first glance. But then it hit me: what if I could use the API to sort by reach? Higher reach usually means bigger budgets for ROI-focused brands, therefore better-performing ads. It felt like finding a secret map. It works for brands that show at least some of their ads in the EU.\n\nBy focusing on ads with high reach, we were essentially spying on our competitors' best-performing ads in real-time. This allowed us to catch trends early and often beat them at their own game. It was like being able to predict the next viral ad before anyone else knew about it.\n\nAfter sharing this with a few marketer friends from other brands, I realised that it’s becoming more and more known but not everyone has the time or resources to develop their own tool around this. Big companies usually keep these kinds of tools to themselves, making it hard for smaller players to compete (the usual story). So, I decided to make a tool and share it with the Reddit community for free. Its not just another tool that 'estimates' performance; I've cross-checked it against multiple accounts, and the Facebook metrics were pretty accurate.\n\nI'll leave the name of the tool in the comments. If you give the tool a try, I'd love to hear your thoughts!\n\nWhat do you think about this approach in general? Has anyone else used the 'reach' metric in this way before? What tactics do you use to identify performing ? What do you think about the whole market copying each other ?\n\nP.S. here are some average numbers of one of the brands (results are 5 weeks apart)\n\nDaily spend $9,408 -&gt; $112,593  \nCTR 1.7% -&gt; %3.2  \nCPC $3 -&gt; $1.2  \nCPL $9 -&gt; $5\n\nEDIT: Hey, after several comments about the login flow and not trusting the app I've made some changes in registration itself. It does not solve the main problem of limited requests, but now you can create account and use the app without registering with facebook. \n\nAs in this case it uses my account and my credentials, the requests will be limited to a few searches per day, but at least you might be able to check the tool if it's useful for you.",

    "selftext": "*Edited*\n\nSo we have had serious conversion problems as many before us had and after reading that most companies struggle the same way one of my companies have struggled i wanted to share how I solved our campaigns:\n\nBusiness: E-com, luxury interior design products\nPrice range: $19-199 per product\nMarket: Europe, US and UAE\n\nAd spend $300-1000/day depending on results.\n\nI also want to share that i have another business which has not at all been affected by this total ad-fuck up that Meta has been having, however the goal is lead and we use a form in that business, not the same conversion goal as this business which has purchase as conversion goal. The other business is also contra cyclic and does better in bad times than good times which is not the case with this company. \n\nAd set up before the crash was simple, we did not use much adv+ and did mostly exclude everything except feed and stories which we found delivered most conversions. \nWe used 2 ad sets one for 9:16 ads and one for 1:1 ads. \nVery broad, all countries in each ad set. No interests. Female only. \n\nWe use lots of creatives and different copy. We invest a lot of time in our ads and i recommend you all to do the same. \n\nWhen the crash hit we started changing our creatives and copy but nothing helped. After a while we stopped our campaigns all together and started testing new ways, adv+, all formats, engagement campaigns, traffic, switching to add to cart and checkout as conv. Goals but nothing gave. Our cost per conv increased from $30 to $300 at the highest and we started loosing a lot of money. \n\nThe solve,\nCBO\n6 ad sets (funnel)\nConv. Goal=purchase\n\nTop funnel (2 ad sets, 9:16 +1:1) Feeds, reels and stories both fb &amp; insta. \n4-6 engaging ads to drive interest. Video and images mixed. Loosers get cut off, winners stay. No ads with discounts, we dont want to engage discount hunters.\nFemale only\nExclusions: add to carts, initiated checkouts &amp; purchase 60 days. Video views, engagement on instagram and fb. \nThis entire funnel is building on with new potential customers only. \n\nMid funnel (2 ad sets, 9:16 + 1:1) Feeds reels and stories both fb and insta.\nAudience, website traffic, content views, Instagram + fb engagement, video views.\nExclusions, add to carts + purchase 30 days.\n4-6 ads. Ad mix, engaging ads and discounted products. \n\nBottom funnel (2 ad sets, 9:16 + 1:1) Feeds reels and stories both fb and insta.\nAudience, add to cart, initiated check outs. \n4 ads. All ads are product focused. 3/4 with discounts. Catalogues are added as enhancement for 1:1 ads. \n\nOur ad account is back to normal and we have our business back finally. \nPlease note that we do not use any of Facebook’s ultra crappy ai tools, my experience is that this is just a way to give Meta your money for nothing in return. They are basically using you as beta testers for their algorithms which are full of bugs and issues and you are actually paying them for it. Do not do this.\n\nWe have now been scaling successfully for a while and do see drops when scaling but the conversion cost has been going down after a few days and stabilizes again.\n\nI hope this solution works for anyone else, let me know if it did, it would really make my day and this post was then worth the time it took to write it.\n\nStay strong and positive 💪\n\nLast edit 2024-05-16",

    "selftext": "Now, I know I might get a lot of pushback here since lots of people seem to be having issues. \n\nBut I was literally there. I was struggling too.\n\nI run an agency. I manage 5+ ad accounts all day (and I have access to 50+ more) because I enjoy it. I know other agency giants like Charley T, Dara, etc. and I've met many of them in person many times. \n\nSince February 14, every account I manage saw a huge downturn. 3-6x ROAS turned into 0.5-1x, and it was persistent. \n\nNow, we pretty much recovered every account. They're all back above 2x. Some are at 5-7x, better than before and at higher spend. Most are spending between $30,000 and $200,000 per month. \n\nI'll spill how we did it. \n\n1. Switched away from 1-campaign targeting and structure. \n\nWe were making tons of creative thinking that content and creative fatigue was the reason returns were bad. But only about 10-20% of the content got any spend. An ad can't really be fatigued if... no one saw it, though. \n\nSo, we switched to using two campaigns — one for cold traffic and one for warm traffic. Why? Because I can't really trust who the algorithm delivers *all* the ads to. Are they going to net new people? Is the algo dividing my budget the way I want between engaged and net new audiences? What if I want the engaged audiences to buy 3x a month instead of 2x? How do I tell the algo this? You don't. \n\nI prefer to give the algorithm guard rails and let it shine within parameters I set. We're still people selling to people, folks.\n\nI set up our cold campaign to exclude anyone who engaged with posts or ads in the last 6 months, and for our warm campaign to only go to those people. \n\nAbout a week after ensuring that our ads are going to entirely new people, our ROAS absolutely shot up. For every account. Everyone's happy right now on my end.\n\nInclude every ad in both campaigns, since you don't want anyone missing out on seeing your best ads. You never know what content a person might prefer. \n\nBut that's about it. \n\nRobots and AI might be great at helping us, but the basics of marketing still apply.\n\nBonus: \n\n1. I have access to the medium-spend Facebook reps you \"unlock\" when you hit $100k/mo in spend. They have me a nice tip that from a recent quietly-deployed update, you can now use the advantage+ audience while adding exclusions. That option is hidden behind the \"more\" drop-down menu in \"audience controls.\"\n\n2. Remember, none of this will work if your content is not good, meaning either entertaining or informative. For most of you who are making tons of content and not seeing much to show for it, this audience switch idea should help.\n\n3. Really think about your buying cycle and see how people think about your product. For example, are people waiting for your product for 7 days after they buy? Then your warm campaigns should exclude buyers for 7-30 days, or whenever is reasonable before re-engaging them.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions or drop any concerns, I'll address them.\n\nEdit: In most cases, it took us 6-7 days to see results after implementing this. So please remember that you have to give it a bit of time to settle in. Most changes on this scale, like changing the entire ad campaign structure you're running, will take about a week to set in.",

    "selftext": "Not a $20M agency, just someone who runs ads for a small DTC brand. I’ve spent the last 18 months figuring out how to stop breaking campaigns every time I try to scale. Here’s what’s been working for me lately:\n\nI used to kill my own results by touching too much. Every time I saw an ad set doing well, I’d raise the budget too fast or duplicate the campaign and hope it would keep working. It almost never did.\n\nWhat finally worked was treating one CBO like a long-term engine. I built it slow, let Facebook optimize, and resisted the urge to touch it daily. Just one broad interest, stacked creatives, and good structure.\n\nWhat helped most:\n\n– I stopped chasing lookalikes and went broad. With good creative, broad targeting performed better and didn’t cap out.  \n– I kept my creative rotation tight. I only tested one new creative every 7–10 days, based on actual data, not a feeling.  \n– My best ad still looks like UGC, even though it’s not. Shot on a phone, casual voice, direct message. It beat out all the fancy studio stuff.\n\nScaling came from increasing budget slowly, not duplicating winners. I let the CBO run for weeks untouched before increasing spend. Instead of going from $100 to $500, I went from $100 to $130, then $170, and so on.\n\nAlso, I tracked performance *outside* the Ads Manager. Blended ROAS helped me stay sane.

    "title": "FB Ads Manager Updates You Should Be Aware Of - June 24, 2024 Roundup",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I can see across several ad accounts and have been noticing a ton of updates being rolled out to different accounts. I am highlighting the ones I think are most important for you to be aware of. You may see none, some or all of these updates in your ads manager. All links are screenshots to the updates mentioned.\n\n1. [Adv+ Creative in Advertising Settings](https://ibb.co/3YbYk0M): Go to Advertising Settings &gt; Advantage+ creative &gt; Test New Optimizations. This is a new setting that was introduced this year which is automatically applied by default. If you read carefully, it says that fewer than 5% of your ad impressions will test new optimizations (AI features) even if you manually turn the enhancements off at the ad level. If your ads are looking strange (additional text, AI generated backgrounds, etc) then this could be why.\n2. [FB 'Encouraging' AI features:](https://ibb.co/6BwJYBs) Be careful when [duplicating campaigns](https://ibb.co/Xjjr27X), Facebook is continuously encouraging us to turn on more and more adv+ 'enhancements'. Ads managers running ads for multiple clients,[ watch out for the 'add catalog items' enhancement.](https://ibb.co/d0Mttxk) This will automatically populate catalogs associated with your business manager. If you miss this, it could potentially show Client A's products on Client B's ads. You can also see in the previous screenshot how FB is trying to be sneaky and hide some enhancements as well.\n3. [Dynamic Creative -&gt; Flexible Ad Format: ](https://ibb.co/HYgYZM8)Facebook is phasing out the dynamic creative ads setting and introducing flexible ad format. Previously, you would enable the dynamic creative option in the ad set level and then add up to 10 creatives into your ad. You could only have 1 dynamic ad per ad set. Now with Flexible ads, the option is [selected at the ad level](https://ibb.co/nzm10Kr) and you create ['groups'](https://ibb.co/HtFHZB7) within the ad level and add 10 creatives per group. You can also have multiple flexible ads per ad set.\n4. [ASC+ Structure:](https://ibb.co/C5Gj1L3) There have been some recent changes to Advantage Shopping Campaigns (ASC+). Before, [ASC+ campaigns combined the campaign level with the ad set level](https://ibb.co/fMP5Lv0). This is still the case for many ad accounts. Recently, Facebook has been rolling out changes where Meta is splitting up the Campaign, ad set and ad level much like a manual campaign. In addition, ASC+ always used to set the budgets at the campaign/ad set level (same). Now with [the new structure](https://ibb.co/xSDdLm7) you can decide between setting the budget at the campaign level (like a typical CBO) or at the ad set level like a typical ABO. Test them both and see if you have different results.\n5. [Add Existing Customers:](https://ibb.co/DVqQn9N) This one has been around for a while but many people are still unaware of it. In Advertising Settings &gt; Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns you can define your existing customers so Facebook can better understand who your existing customers and engaged audience are and more accurately retarget or exclude them from ASC+ and manual campaigns. Utilizing this feature allows you to use the Breakdown tool to see a breakdown between existing and new customers. (Breakdown on the campaign tab in ads manager &gt; Audience Segment)\n6. [Ad Level Scheduling:](https://ibb.co/mCszQMF) Ad Scheduling seems to have moved from the ad set level to the ad level. This can be useful if you are running a specific promotion for a specific ad and want to schedule it to start/stop on certain days/times. Click 'show more options' below the multi-advertisers ads checkbox to see the ad level scheduling options.\n7. [Original Audience Options Phasing Out:](https://ibb.co/7brHB9Y) Some Ad accounts [no longer have the option to switch to original audience options.](https://ibb.co/QP1CX8t) That means you will have to use Facebook's new Adv+ Audience which leverages the new AI and machine learning features.\n8. [Expanded Calendar UI:](https://ibb.co/JpRpNgw)  But wait, theres more! They are rolling out new calendar UI with expanded options and compare functionality.\n9. [Ads Manager View Filtering](https://ibb.co/hXvfzXQ): I saw this one get rolled out across several accounts. It then seemingly caused an small outage and was rolled back on most accounts. Now they are slowly rolling it out again. Basically you can save different filtering options and quickly click on the different views as needed.\n10. [FB Creating and Forcing Automated Rules](https://ibb.co/gMtG0Cy): This one might be the worst of all. FB is automatically creating automated rules which can 'reduce audience overlap' and 'fragmentation' by closing and consolidating ad sets automatically. Also, it can automatically apply the enhancements above including the catalog enhancement which I mentioned in #2. The crazy part is I turned off and deleted these rules and then they reappeared and were reenabled by Meta after a few days. I turned it off again and deleted it and now it hasn't happened again.\n\nGreat, now you're caught up with the latest updates. Thanks for reading. If you found this useful please share it with fellow ads managers so they can be aware of all the changes as well. Drop any questions or comments below.",

    "title": "Advice to who is struggling with Meta Ads",
    "selftext": "Here I'm again with some advices. As you notices since Feb 2024 Meta just gone wild and there are really no rules now. Most of the experts out there (specially on youtube) are just full of sh\\*t trying to tell you that you are the problem so you need to buy their course.\n\nSome courses are great of course but most of them are just made by loosers claiming they spent millions of $ in ads while the reality is that when they show you the dashboards they just change the currency to Argentinian Peso and guess why? It's the same symbol as the Dollars.\n\nSo what works right now for me (Sales campaigns):\n\n* I don't listen to who is spending 3k a day. Most of you indie solo marketers can't afford to spend 3K a day and most of your clients just can't even imagine spending 300$ a day so let's be realistic here.\n* Right now I manage few campaigns which are spending 50$ a day and are giving back in profit 400$ every single day. This is what I call a more realistic approach.\n* Scaling: this is a tough one. What you need to understand that Meta is very different from other Ads Platform as Propeller Ads can be. It's not real time Zones/Placements managing. Meta now is all about Creatives. Just keep in mind that when you use 50$/day budget it's 50/24= 2$ a hour. When you scale from 50 to 54, you basicly giving Meta 4$ more for the entire day. You see? It's like telling Meta:\"Hey, use these 0.16 cents a hour wisely! Don't spend to much!. You can see how this is a total nonsense. What can possibly Meta do with your 0.16 cents per hour? They just swallow them and that's it. You need to scale with Creatives.\n* Why Creatives? Let me explain it to you as to a 12 years old boy:\"Which is your dream car? Which is the car you see on the street makes your head turn and dream to have it one day?\". This is how powerful your creatives needs to be. In an ocean of creatives (cars), yours must be the one the user will turn his head and click on it. Once you get your winner, you will smile like a baby in front of a Porsche gt3 RS.\n* Be aware of bot traffic. In the last 5 days I has a shitload of bot traffic from Thailand (46% of my traffic from Meta Ads). You need to be able to spot this traffic and cut it.\n* Back to Creatives...test at least 4 new creatives a Week. The more you spend on Ads, the more you should test.\n* When you don't see results one day. Don't panic. Stay calm. Bad days happen. It's part of the game.\n\nDon't blame Meta for being shit. Adapt or leave Meta and explore other Advertising Platforms. Complaining is a waste of time.\n\nHave a good one. Peace.",

The problem is, if this situation isn’t resolved by May 2nd, my accounts risk being restricted again, causing even more damage.  \n\nMeta acknowledges the fraud (Webex recording, police report, legal letters, Loom video), but the refund process is still pending. For now, I have filed a complaint against the hackers, so against unknown persons (\"against X\"), but I’ve heard that the best way to speed things up is to take legal action directly against Meta even though they are also technically victims. From what I’ve been told, this is often the fastest way to get the situation resolved.\n\nIf anyone has experienced something similar or knows how to escalate this faster within Meta, any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

I usually check this sub to see how ads are performing but it's kind of hard to judge by going by one off posts by users. I think if we had verified insights on how ads are doing, we could have a better idea on how much we should spend on ads or what creatives we should change.\n\nHere's how it works: You can submit Facebook Ads account data to the platform, no specific details, just campaign structure, CPC for your campaigns, CPM, etc. Every week, I update the community-averaged data for key metrics like ROAS, CPC, and CPM, and also send out an email so you can see how your ads are performing in comparison to the broader community.\n\nAs more advertisers join, not only will the data get more accurate, but we'll be able to provide even deeper insights—like identifying the best-performing ad structures and exploring what really happened with Facebook Ads over the last year.  \nIf you're looking for a straightforward way to keep tabs on FB ad performance and want to be part of a growing community of advertisers, I'd love for you to check it out and give your feedback. Let me know any other metrics you want me to add to the dashboard. Let's make sense of what's really happening with Facebook Ads and see if we can get profitable again together!\n\nThanks!",

    "title": "After 8+ years managing Facebook ads, I can usually tell within 5 minutes if an ad account will struggle to scale",
    "selftext": "One time I was on a consultation call with a business owner going through their Facebook ads and they asked \"I've tested dozens of audiences and nothing is working. Which targeting should I try next?\"\n\nFrom there, I didn’t suggest new audiences, I first looked at his campaign structure and to see what his campaigns were optimized for.\n\nTurns out he'd been running traffic campaigns for the past 3 weeks to \"build up data\" before switching to conversions. His pixel had thousands of events, but they were all landing page views from people who click on everything and buy nothing.\n\nThat was the issue, something that even if they were using profitable audience targeting, it wouldn’t work.\n\nI see this quite often where people obsess over targeting, bidding strategies, ad creative, scaling hacks. But when the foundation is broken and none of that other stuff matters until they fix it.\n\nI've been managing Facebook ads since 2015. Over that time I've managed $7M+ in ad spend across hundreds of accounts. And the single biggest factor that separates accounts that scale from accounts that struggle isn't targeting or creative. It's data quality.\n\n**Why data quality determines everything**\n\nThe algorithm optimizes based on the data you feed it. This sounds obvious but most people don't think through what it actually means.\n\nIf your pixel is full of clickers who never buy or people who only like and comment, Facebook learns what those people look like and finds you more of them. If your pixel is trained on people who add to cart but abandon, you get more of those. The algorithm is doing exactly what you told it to do.\n\nI worked with a home decor brand that was focused on getting likes and clicks on their boosted posts. Their pixel was full of low-quality data from months of optimizing for the wrong things. I restructured their campaigns to focus on purchases only, and we hit a 3.44x ROAS.\n\nThis is why the same \"winning strategy\" works for some people and completely fails for others. The strategy isn't the variable. The data foundation is.\n\n**The 3 stages of data health**\n\nWhen I audit an ad account, I'm basically trying to figure out which of these three stages it's in. Because the strategies that work depend entirely on the answer.\n\nStage 1: Polluted data\n\nYour pixel has been trained on low-quality events. This happens if you've run traffic campaigns, optimized for landing page views, or chased cheap CPMs and engagement. The pixel has lots of data, but it's data about the wrong people.\n\nThe algorithm thinks it knows who your customer is. But it's wrong, because you trained it on clickers and scrollers instead of buyers.\n\nStage 2: Thin data\n\nYour pixel has quality purchase data, but not enough of it. You're getting under 50 conversions per month. The algorithm doesn't have enough information to find patterns, so it's guessing more than optimizing.\n\nThis is where a lot of newer stores get stuck. They're doing the right things but haven't hit the volume threshold where the algorithm can really work for them.\n\nStage 3: Quality data\n\nYou're getting at least 50+ purchases per month from real buyers. The algorithm has a clear picture of who converts and can reliably find more of them. This is when advanced strategies, tighter ROAS targets, and scaling actually work.\n\nMost of the strategies you see shared online assume you're in Stage 3. When people try to apply them in Stage 1 or 2, they wonder why nothing works.\n\n**What to do at each stage**\n\nStage 1 (Polluted): Stop feeding it garbage. Switch to optimizing for purchases only, even if volume drops initially. The good news is your pixel isn't permanently ruined. As you feed it higher quality data, the old low-quality data eventually flushes out and gets replaced. It takes time, but the algorithm will recalibrate.\n\nStage 2 (Thin): Focus on volume over efficiency temporarily. Don't constrain the algorithm with ROAS targets or cost caps yet. Your only job right now is feeding it more quality purchase data. Once you're consistently above 50 conversions per month, you can start adding constraints.\n\nStage 3 (Quality): Now you can layer on ROAS targets, test cost caps, segment campaigns by product margin, run more advanced retargeting. The foundation supports it. Strategies that would have killed delivery in Stage 1 or 2 will actually work here.\n\n**The biggest data quality mistakes I keep seeing**\n\nRunning traffic or engagement campaigns \"to test creative first.\" You're not just testing creative. You're actively training your pixel on the wrong people. Every click from someone who was never going to buy makes your data worse.\n\nOptimizing for add to cart because purchases are \"too expensive.\" You get what you optimize for. If you tell Facebook to find people who add to cart, that's what you'll get. Many of those people have no intention of buying. They're just browsers.\n\nCopying a strategy from someone getting 500 purchases a month when you're getting 20. Their account is in a completely different stage. The algorithm behaves differently when it has that much data to work with. What works for them won't work for you yet.\n\nNever actually checking what your pixel has recorded. I'm surprised how many people have never looked at Events Manager to see what data their pixel actually has. They're making decisions blind.\n\n**How to diagnose your own account**\n\nBefore you change anything else, figure out where you actually are.\n\nCheck Events Manager. Go look at what events your pixel has recorded over the last 28 days. How many purchases? How many add to carts? What's the ratio? If you have 5,000 landing page views and 12 purchases, that tells you something.\n\nLook at your campaign history. What have you been running? Have you spent months on traffic campaigns or engagement campaigns? That data is in your pixel now, affecting how the algorithm optimizes.\n\nBe honest about your volume. If you're getting fewer than 50 purchases per month, you're in Stage 2 at best. Don't try to run Stage 3 strategies.\n\nThe strategies you should use depend entirely on which stage you're in. There's no universal \"best\" approach. There's only what's right for your current data situation.\n\n**Final thoughts**\n\nI know this is foundational stuff. It's not as exciting as a new scaling hack or secret audience. But this is where most ad accounts go wrong, and fixing it makes everything else easier.\n\nI also put together a free advanced Facebook ads course that goes deeper into data foundations, campaign structure, scaling, and optimization. If you want access, let me know and I'll send it over.\n\nHope this helped, thanks for reading!",

    "title": "Meta's Support is a Nightmare – Our Business Manager is Now Completely Useless",
    "selftext": "I’m managing a reputable brand, and we’ve run into a major issue with our Meta Business Manager account. The account was originally linked to a previous employee who no longer has access to the phone number used for 2FA. You’d think this would be a straightforward problem to fix, but not with Meta.\n\nWe’ve been in contact with over six different support agents, each from different parts of the world. Every time, I had to explain the entire situation from scratch, and not one of them was able to offer any real help. In fact, one of them even hung up on me mid-conversation—absolutely unacceptable.\n\nTheir phone support is completely clueless. They couldn’t solve even the most basic issues. After countless emails and back-and-forth, we jumped through all the hoops they set, including verifying documents of the previous account holder. We provided everything they requested, only for them to close the case without any resolution.\n\nWhen I reopened the case and asked why it was closed without being solved, I had to spend another 40 minutes explaining the situation to yet another representative. They finally told me that the documents were requested as part of some “process.” What process? They couldn’t even clarify that. And then they had the nerve to tell me it was our fault for losing the phone number linked to the account. What kind of bullshit is that?\n\nNow, we’re stuck in a situation where our account can’t be properly linked to run ads, can’t be deleted, and essentially can’t do anything. We’re in limbo, unable to move forward, and all because of Meta’s completely incompetent support system. They’ve left us with a Business Manager that’s completely useless, and no clear path to fixing it.\n\nMeta needs to seriously up their game with support. This experience has been nothing short of a nightmare.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI gave up and couldn’t solve the issue.",

    "title": "I helped build Meta's BFCM ad delivery system",
    "selftext": "Ex-Meta engineer here who spent 5+ years building their ads algorithm. I'm seeing a lot of outdated advice about campaign structure, so I wanted to share what actually works in 2024, especially for BFCM periods.\n\nA few critical points first:\n\n* All campaigns use purchase optimization by default\n* Minimum starting budget: $150/day for proper signal collection\n* Bad creative or offers won't work with any structure\n* This is a diamond-shaped structure, not a funnel (Level 1, 2, 3)\n* When I say \"data\", I mean server-side signals feeding Meta's algorithm\n* First-party data means both platform engagement AND server-side website data\n\n**Level 1 - Server Signal Collection**\n\nHere's what most people miss: During high-traffic periods like BFCM, Meta's system processes 600% more events than usual. The key is collecting high-quality server-side signals before the rush.\n\nThink of it like this: You own a store in a mall during Black Friday. Would you rather track only the people who made it to your checkout counter, or would you want data on everyone who showed purchase intent? The smart move is capturing all high-quality signals, not just the obvious ones.\n\nFrom my time building these systems, I can tell you that server-side signals get weighted 3x higher than pixel data during BFCM. Since founding [Aimerce](http://aimerce.ai), I’ve helped Shopify brands prep for BFCM using the same playbook we built internally. A proper server-side setup can capture valuable signals for under $0.20 per user, compared to $2-5 for traditional pixel-based retargeting.\n\n**Level 2 - Signal Enhancement**\n\nOnce you've collected clean server-side data, you amplify it. Meta's system rebuilds audience models every 6-8 hours during BFCM instead of the usual 24-48 hours. You need to feed it consistent, high-quality signals.\n\nThis level should get the highest budget because it's where the algorithm learns the most. We specifically built the system to recognize patterns in user behavior during high-intent periods like BFCM.\n\nPro tip: Use server-side events for everything - product views, add to carts, initiate checkouts. The algorithm weighs these signals differently during holiday periods.\n\n**Level 3 - Conversion Drive**\n\nIf someone has engaged with ads in Level 1, seen multiple ads in Level 2, and still hasn't converted, this is where you show your best offers. But here's the key: during BFCM, the algorithm has a special \"holiday mode\" that adjusts bid models based on conversion patterns.\n\nTechnical Implementation:\n\nThe most crucial part is proper server-side implementation. Here's what matters:\n\n* Real-time API integration\n* Server-side event processing\n* First-party data collection\n* Value-based optimization\n* Custom server events\n\nThis setup is the same structure we help brands implement at Aimerce. It’s wild how often the missing piece is just one misfiring server event or a weak deduplication rule.\n\nCurrent results across accounts:\n\n* One account: $2k/day spend, 6.2x ROAS with pure server-side setup\n* Another account: $500/day, 4.8x ROAS focusing on first-party signals\n* BFCM results: Consistently seeing 3-4x better performance with server-side vs pixel\n\nThe key is quality first-party data feeding into platforms' algorithms. With proper implementation, I regularly see 2-3x ROAS improvement.\n\nHappy to answer any questions!",

    "title": "Meta Ads Manager Updates You Should Be Aware Of - June 10, 2025 Roundup",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone, I have been seeing a ton of updates across ad accounts over the last few months so I figured I would make a post highlighting the most important ones for you to be aware of. \n\nYou may see none, some or all of these updates in your ads manager. All links are screenshots to the updates mentioned. I also added support docs if you want to learn more about a particular feature. Let's begin...\n\n# 1. Adv+ Sales Campaigns replacing Advantage Shopping Campaigns (ASC+)\n\nPreviously, when you would click Create &gt; Sales in the ads manager, you would see [this screen.](https://ibb.co/xt4y5wr5) It would ask you if you want to create an ASC+ campaign or a manual campaign. With the latest update, you no longer get the option. It automatically creates an [Advantage+ Sales Campaign.](https://ibb.co/LhvCkXwD) \n\n**What's the difference?**   \nASC+ campaigns combined the campaign level and the ad set level, so all you could do was set your objective, conversion event, location, budget, schedule and creatives. Meta's algo did the rest. This actually works really well on some accounts in my experience. Of course, Meta had to go ahead and mess with something that was working.\n\nWith the new Adv+ Sales Campaigns your campaign and ad set are separate, allowing you to have multiple ad sets. When you create an Adv+ Sales campaign, you will notice in the top right of the screen there is a widget that shows your Campaign Score, and all the Adv+ features you have ON including: Budget (formerly CBO vs. ABO), Audience (formerly Adv+ Audience vs. Original Audience Options) and Placements. \n\n**Campaign Budget:** if you select [\"Campaign Budget](https://ibb.co/N6Lc1LsC)\" you will be giving Meta your budget at the campaign level and allow it's algorithms to decide how that budget is spent among your ad sets. This used to be called \"Campaign Budget Optimization\" (CBO), then they called it \"Advantage Campaign Budget\" and now it's called \"Budget with Adv+ On.\" So confusing (thanks, Meta). \n\n**Ad set Budget:** if you select \"[Ad set budget](https://ibb.co/PGCnsCGB)\" you will be giving Meta your budget at the ad set level. This used to be called \"Ad Set Budget Optimization\" (ABO) but now it is referred to as \"Budget with Adv+ off.\" \n\nI still refer to both of these as CBO vs. ABO personally.\n\n**Audience:** [Adv+ audience](https://ibb.co/LdmrmtWT) is on by default. This uses Meta's latest AI to find your audience for you. You are able to select your location, minimum age, languages, add custom audiences and select interests. With Adv+ Audience, your inputs are all treated as \"suggestions\" and Meta's algo will automatically expand past your suggestions when it thinks it can achieve a conversion. \n\nIf you want to switch to what was formally known as \"Original Audience Options\" you now have to click \"Further limit the reach of your ads\" &gt; [Switch Setup.](https://ibb.co/7t4JRzJL) Now you will have more control over your audience settings. You can now set specific ages and segment by gender. Notice in the top right corner of the \"Audience\" Module that Adv+ stays on until you limit your audience in some way. When you limit your audience, a checkbox that says [\"Use as a suggestion\" ](https://ibb.co/93Nh2728)will pop up. If you uncheck this, Meta won't expand past your audience setting inputs. If you limit your audience by 2 or more parameters, Adv+ audience will switch OFF. \n\n**Placements:** Placements works the same as before. If you have \"Placements with Adv+ On\" Meta will automatically serve your ad across it's suite of products. Some notable placement additions are [Threads](https://ibb.co/M5Wh6X3x) and [Facebook Notifications.](https://ibb.co/mrmksLHb) If you manually select placements, you will turn Adv+ Off for placements.\n\nRead more: [https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1362234537597370](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1362234537597370)\n\n# 2. Opportunity Score\n\nMeta rolled out \"Opportunity Score\" which looks across all of your campaigns, ad sets and ads and gives you recommendations on how to optimize them \\*according to Meta. You are given a score from 0-100, 100 being fully optimized. \n\nWhat you need to be aware of is that not all of these recommendations are made equal. If you hover over the little \"i\" icon next to them, you will see some are based on [real-time modeling data](https://ibb.co/whnM1j8v) while others are based on [experiments](https://ibb.co/k6SYCTpQ) run years ago with small sample sizes with random conversion objectives (i.e. traffic).\n\nI think some of these recommendations are probably good but many are bad and will cause worse performance. Be very careful and read each recommendation thoroughly and ask yourself if this is worth it. In my opinion, gamifying the ads manager is another way for Meta to get advertisers to spend more on the platform. Use at your own discretion. \n\nRead more: [https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/opportunity-score](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/opportunity-score)\n\n# 3. Value Rules\n\nMeta now allows you to tell Meta which particular audiences are more valuable to your business.\n\nThis [new feature](https://ibb.co/qYJmxM33) can be found in ad set level &gt; Conversion section or in Advertiser Settings. You can create a \"rule set\" with up to 10 rules that allow you increase or decrease your bid for specific Ages, Genders, Operating Systems and Locations. You can only select 1 rule set (with up to 10 rules) per ad set at a time. \n\n  \n**How multiple rules work:** If a person meets the criteria for multiple rules, we’ll only apply the first applicable rule in the list.  \n\n\nFor example:  \nRule 1: Increase bid by 20% for women in California∙\n\nRule 2: Increase bid by 10% for women who use an iOS operating system\n\nThen for a women in California who uses an iOS operating system, we will bid 20% higher for her, because Rule 1 comes first in the order.\n\nThis is a feature that I am quite excited for and will be experimenting with across ad accounts. \n\nRead more: [https://www.facebook.com/business/help/535014515741813](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/535014515741813)\n\n# 4. Incremental Attribution\n\nMeta released a new attribution setting called \"[incremental attribution](https://ibb.co/VWSqHjTM)\". This setting optimizes ad delivery for \"incremental\" conversions using AI models to predict whether or not the conversion was truly caused by the ad. \n\nYou can select this setting in the ad set level &gt; Conversions &gt; show more settings &gt; Attribution settings.\n\nSo far I have heard people giving mixed reviews on this setting. Some report that the results were not good. I would image this setting (like all AI) will improve as it gathers more data. \n\nRemember, you can always [compare your attribution settings](https://ibb.co/DDFTXmR7) by clicking on \"Columns\" in your ads manager then \"Compare attribution settings.\" You can use this to compare 1-day click, 7-day click, 28-day click, 1-day view, 1-day engaged view and incremental attribution models so see where your conversions are coming from. \n\nRead more: [https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2366718460372682](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2366718460372682)\n\n# 5. Checkout in Meta Shops going away\n\n[Emails have been circulating](https://ibb.co/20xnLNNh) that say that Meta will no longer be allowing customers to checkout through your Facebook &amp; Instagram Shops. Instead, customers will be directed to your website for checkout. \n\nThis is an interesting development because it seems like they are pivoting away from controlling the full customer journey. I am sure more info will come out about this. \n\nRead more: [https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1314349509894768](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1314349509894768)\n\n# 6. Creative Setup &gt; Site Links, Branding, Catalog\n\nWhen you set up your ad creative, you will be greeted with a [new wizard](https://ibb.co/r2TTq8kk) that is incredibly annoying to work with. The first page (Creative Setup) has various drop downs for Branding, Site Links, Catalog Items and Promotions. \n\n**Branding** \\- allows you to set colors, logo and fonts for their AI text and image generation.\n\n**Site Links** \\- adds deep links from your website to the bottom of your ad.\n\n**Catalog** \\- adds your product catalog set below your ad. \n\nI never use branding because I don't use Meta's AI text or image generation. Site Links is not a good feature imo. Why divert traffic to other webpages other than the one you want? (i.e. Terms, About page, etc)\n\nCatalogs I use sometimes for eCom brands. This one is OK. \n\nIf I had a dollar for every time I had to turn one of these features off I would be filthy rich. \n\n# 7. More Adv+ Creative Enhancements\n\nMeta is continually rolling out new adv+ creative enhancements. Some notable ones are Translate Text and Translate Voiceover. These will translate your ads in real-time which could be really cool. \n\nAgain, I spend most of my time creating ads turning off these enhancements. I may use a few here and there but generally I haven't found that these improve performance for me. In some rare cases when nothing is working, I will turn them all on and let Meta do it's thing. Sometimes it works. \n\nImportant: Keep a close eye inside of Advertiser Settings &gt; Adv+ Creative &gt; Test new creative enhancements &amp; test new AI generation features. Meta is automatically enrolling you in these. They will spend up to 5% of your daily budget testing their new features (training their algo). You need to manually opt out of these things regularly. \n\n# 8. Share Ad set budget\n\nMeta is starting to roll out a new feature called \"[ad set budget sharing.](https://ibb.co/mFbz1r7P)\" We can think of this like CBO-lite. Basically when you set up an ABO, a new checkbox appears that says \"Share some of your budget with other ad sets.\"  \n\n  \nThis setting allows you to still choose the budget at the ad set level but allows Meta to direct up to 20% of spend towards another ad set if it thinks it can reach the conversion goal (volume, manual bid, etc)\n\nThis is a pretty interesting development and makes me think ABO could potentially go away all together one day.\n\nRead more: [https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1388266028979935/](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1388266028979935/)\n\n# 9. Andromeda / Lattice \n\nUnderpinning all these new features are these 4 core updates to their algorithms. They've been working on these for several years but have been rolling them out more extensively over the last few months. \n\n**Meta GEM: The Super Brain** \\- GEM is a powerful new machine learning model trained on thousands of GPUs to optimize ad results. Meta describes it as having a super brain that can read an entire library of books in seconds, understand the relationship between all the characters, remember every single detail, and connect the details into an understanding of the sequence of events a person goes through across all types of activities.\n\n  \n**Meta Lattice: The Giant Library -** this is Meta's ad ranking architecture that allows them to generalize learnings across campaign objectives and surfaces in place of numerous, smaller ad models that historically were optimize for individual objectives and surfaces. The algorithms used to be like many small libraries, each dedicated to a difference subject. Now they've combined all those libraries into one.\n\n**Meta Andromeda: The Personal Concierge -**  new end-to-end hardware, software and machine learning that allows the system to process models that are 10,000x more complex. This helps the algorithm narrow down the pool of relevant people much faster than before.\n\n  \n**Sequence Learning: The Memory Game -** the algorithm now takes into account the sequence of actions a person takes before and after seeing an ad. For example, before if you converted on a ski resort ad...you would continue to get more and more ski resort ads. But now, you will start to get ads for ski gear, lift tickets, etc. Pretty amazing. \n\nRead more about this here: [https://www.facebook.com/business/news/ai-innovation-in-metas-ads-ranking-driving-advertiser-performance](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/ai-innovation-in-metas-ads-ranking-driving-advertiser-performance)\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nMeta continues to invest heavily in innovations around AI. Although it is very disruptive &amp; volatile right now, I believe the algorithms are going to get incredibly sophisticated and lead to really good performance in the long run.   \n  \nAt the same time, It seems like Meta is moving more and more towards a 'black box' model. It is pretty clear that they want to 'cut out the middle man' and work directly with business owners. Judging by their current suite of AI features, I believe we are a ways away from that. Even still, creative strategy/content is still going to be extremely valuable for many years to come. \n\nI hope you found this helpful.

Between the Advantage+ role outs, AI enhancements, and Gen AI tools Meta has completely transformed Ads Manager / Ad Delivery.*  \n  \n*But along the way came bugs. It comes with the territory, after all this is a company that moves fast, breaks things remember. However this year was so much more.*  \n  \n*Do I blame Meta for ad performance as in my CPA? Not fully... I still believe it's far more related to the economy than say Meta's delivery bugs. However the delivery bugs, ad disruptions, AI tools have largely created problems for advertisers and led to so many wasted man hours fixing and retooling because of it.*  \n  \n*I'd imagine that in 2025 we've collectively spent a year's worth of wasted time identifying, configuring, toggling, and turning off Meta's AI Enhancements. And I was part of the Alpha for ASC+! I usually have all AI enhancements on, but recently have paid the price with all the bugs. Now clients want them off.*   \n  \n*This is how we as advertisers lose trust and faith in Meta.*  \n  \n*Meta is the most powerful tool for DTC advertisers in middle and bottom of funnel that none of us will turn it off despite all the issues that Meta has.*  \n  \n*Meta knows this and that's the problem and why I'm critical.*  \n  \n*Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"*",

    "title": "Click fraud rates on Meta Ads vs other ad networks (December 2025)",
    "selftext": "Hi all\n\nBelow are the click fraud rates by ad network for September 2025 - December 2025.\n\n* Meta (Facebook): 6%\n\n* Meta (Instagram): 38%\n\n* Meta (Audience): 67%\n\n* Google (Search): 13%\n\n* Google (Display): 27%\n\n* Google (YouTube): 5%\n\n* Linked In (Platform): 17% \n\n* Linked In (Audience): 24%\n\n* Microsoft (Search): 14%\n\n* Microsoft (Audience): 24%\n\n* TikTok (Platform): 68%\n\n* TikTok (Audience): 79%\n\n--------\n\nNotes:\n\n* The amount of click fraud you'll get depends on a number of factors: the industry, location, language, campaign setup, and history of click fraud (especially fake conversions).\n\n* The data contains objective detection only (100% proven to be a bot). I have excluded \"suspicious\" traffic as that doesn't really tell us anything (maybe a bot, maybe a human), so you can consider the numbers to be the minimum amount of click fraud by ad network.\n\n* The reason search ads / platform ads get click fraud is due to a click fraud technique called \"retargeting click fraud\".\n\n* The reason display / audience network ads get lots of click fraud is because that's where the criminals earn money from this scam - they own the display / audience websites, so for every fake view / click they get paid by the ad network.\n\n* If you're new to all this, click fraud exists because it allows criminals to steal your ad budget. The flow of money is advertiser -&gt; ad network -&gt; criminal's website. At least $100B is stolen from advertisers every year due to click fraud, and the ad networks do very little to stop it since they rely on click fraud for their revenue targets.\n\n* The way to stop click fraud is to prevent the bots from generating fake conversions. That's because the ad networks send you traffic which looks like your converting traffic, so if you only allow human conversions, you'll be sent human traffic. How do you do this? Either use purchase conversions only, or offline conversions, or competent bot protection.\n\n* Two of the signs you have a click fraud problem are spam leads and excessive abandoned checkouts.\n\n* Marketing teams commonly choose to buy bot traffic as it helps them hit their KPIs - number of visitors, number of leads, and low cost per lead. Regardless of quality.\n\n* I work in the bot protection industry, have been a click fraud researcher for 12 years, and I'm currently doing a doctorate in this topic.\n\nBottom line: Use purchase conversions only, or offline conversions, or competent bot protection to stop the click fraud.",

    "title": "If You're Struggling W/ FB Ads... Read This",
    "selftext": "So, a lot of you aren't going to like this.\n\nThose of you who work at agencies ESPECIALLY won't like this, because it's gonna make those of you who are lazy and blame everyone else for your problems... \n\nWell it's gonna make you look like you're lazy, and blame everyone else for your problems.\n\nSo here's my central thesis for this post, done in my best Alec Baldwin impersonation:\n\n\"Facebook's not weak, YOU'RE weak!\"\n\nOkay, fair enough, Facebook is actually kinda shitty. But have you heard that old (admittedly misogynistic) joke, \"Women, can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em?\"\n\nWell that describes FB. \n\nI hate FB. I despise it with every fiber of my being.\n\nBut... it also makes me a lot of money. So I still run a lot of ads on there.\n\nQuick note about me so you know I'm not some random dipshit: Been in online marketing for a long time, been running ads for about 5 years. Currently do about $5mm a year in spend, a decent chunk of it with my own personal cash for my own business. I still consult and run ads in JV/partnership deals, however, so not ALL my own money.\n\nSo, lots of posts lately about FB being shitty. Interestingly enough like many things there have always been these posts en masse. ios14 was a huge turning point in this industry. And it seems to keep getting worse and worse.\n\nThat said there's still people CRUSHING it on FB on a daily basis. Individuals who are doing 50k - 100k in spend a day (I've been one of them, right now more like 20k a day though.)\n\nAnd these are direct response guys, not big ass brands who can afford to throw cash away.\n\nSo the question is... why are you struggling and they aren't?\n\nWell first of all let me let you in on a secret: FB sucks for them too. It sucks for me, it sucks for all of us.\n\nBut if you want to be successful, you need to focus on what you  CAN control, not what you can't.\n\nSo here's my rules for success:\n\n1. UNDERSTAND FACEBOOK SUCKS\n\nI've run five copies of the exact same ad in the same ad set at the same time and gotten wildly different results. That's why I test the way I do (Test images/videos and copy at the same time, so I can have duplicates of everything and cross reference/aggregate performance)\n\nAlso understand something that works in your market is half the battle... you need something FB likes too. Which you'll never know what it is until you stumble upon it. \n\nWhich brings me to my next point...\n\n2. YOU'RE NOT TESTING ENOUGH\n\nI've seen SO MANY posts where people are like, \"We've tested TEN IMAGES and nothing works!!!\"\n\nMy friend. 10 images is what I test in a day. I've been known to test 100 videos a week. I'll write ten pieces of copy for one day's testing.\n\nDo I do this every day? No. I wish I could. I don't have the time/energy. But ideally I SHOULD be doing this every day.\n\nNow if you're running a budget of $100/day obviously you have a lot less you can test. \n\nBut my point is... even for those of us who know what we're doing... it takes a LOT of creative testing to get a hit.\n\nCreative testing should be 80% of your time on FB. The guys who tell you it's about the campaign structure or whatever... I mean yeah that stuff is important and can help. But if your creative is good you can kind of ignore that stuff and still get decent results.\n\nOh and every account is different in terms of what it likes. So you kind of have to treat them separately and test creatives on each. Have fun!\n\n3. IF YOU'RE A MEDIA BUYER AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND CREATIVE YOU SHOULD GET A NEW JOB\n\nLook, not everyone is a great copywriter, or video producer, or artist. \n\nBut any good media buyer should be able to take a guess at WHY the creative isn't working, and what should be changed. They should know how to test in a way that is getting these insights that can then be used to further iterate on and improve creatives. \n\nI have met some media buyers who don't know shit about creative but are great at scaling. They're rare, but they're out there. Maybe 10 - 20% of great media buyers are like this. But these people could never fly solo. They only shine in a team with a big creative producing \"engine\". And they still know how to test to get that learning - they just don't really know why.\n\n4. YOUR TESTING STRATEGY SUCKS \n\nTests are experiments. They should, as much as possible, isolate one variable. \n\nSo many times I hear about people testing in different campaigns, or on different days of the week, or whatever.\n\nNo. Testing is in one campaign. Usually different ad sets because otherwise FB will pick a favorite, but if I could throw all ads in one ad set and have FB evenly spend I'd do that. \n\nFurthermore, you should have a very clear goal when you test. \"We're testing angles.\" \"We're testing whether red or blue gets a better CPC.\" \"We're testing which of these 10 pieces of ad text does the best.\"\n\nDon't just throw up a bunch of random videos. At least not often. Test one element. An intro. A CTA. Whatever. Have a plan, and stick to it. \n\n5. WHAT AGENCIES TELL YOU IS BULLSHIT\n\nAnd the worst part is then the people working there start to believe it.\n\nA small incomplete sample of bullshit things I've heard:\n\n\"Facebook has to get out of the learning phase.\"\n\nFalse. A good creative will work pretty much straight away. FB's pixel's been dogshit since ios14. Yes, generally training a pixel will help, but this \"it needs 7 days of learning\" horse shit is just that... horse shit. Often said by people who want to make excuses rather than get down and dirty and do the hard work - making good creatives.\n\n\"The pixel takes time to learn.\"\n\nA half-truth, see above.\n\n\"It takes a month to even start getting data\"\n\nIf I took a month to get data I'd be destitute. You should be able to test if a campaign is going to work in a week, assuming you have the creative ready to go. \n\nIf you can't figure out whether something's going to work in a week or two and 1 - 2k of spend, you suck at your job.\n\nIf you can't spend 1k a week, then you're working with a client that's super small and that has its own set of challenges, especially on FB. \n\nAnd if an agency tells you they can't give you some damn good data and an action plan on exactly what you should do in a week or two, run from them and find someone else.\n\nThere are more that get my goat but you get the point.\n\nBTW... MOST (not all) agencies work like this:\n\nThey sell you a ton of bullshit. You sign on as a client. They give you a junior they get from the Philippines or Eastern Europe for like $400 a month while charging you $3k. They give you endless excuses for months on why results aren't there until you finally leave but hey at that point they got like $15k in profit out of you... they don't care.\n\nWHY I POSTED THIS:\n\n1. Because there are people on here who believe this shit and waste time spinning their wheels when they could be getting traction\n\n2. Because I hate lies and incompetence\n\n3. Because I enjoy watching all the terrible media buyers come out of the wood work and try to argue with me on why I'm wrong (seriously, do it. Let's go. I need to procrastinate when I should be writing copy.)\n\nAnd if you think I'm looking for clients... I'm not. I don't really have the time. Unless you want to do a profit share deal and your biz is already doing at least $1mm a year in revenue, then yeah, PM me, but it's gotta be a very attractive proposition for me to work on your shit. \n\nFull disclosure: I am considering starting a YT channel where I basically get drunk and/or high and rant about shit like this for 5 - 10 minutes at a time. But as you know there's no money in that.\n\nIN CONCLUSION:\n\nMost of the shit you've heard is dead wrong and spread by people who either don't know any better or want to sell you this fantasy that ads are impossible. They're not. They're just a lot of hard fucking work.\n\nBTW, you can reach out to me via PM for questions but honestly I'd rather you post it here so we get a discussion going and please don't take it personally if I don't have the time to answer back. \n\nNow stop being on reddit and go make some more creatives and write some more copy to test. \n\nOh, and to all the lame media buyers who are upset that someone's shining a light on just how lazy and useless they are: \n\nBring it on, bitch.",

    "selftext": "Good day, Redditors!\n\nFacebook recently released a new update that gives everyone a hint about where to focus.\n\nLet's get into it!\n\nSo, the new update is related to the ad copy, especially the first lines that can be seen in the ads before you click to see more.\n\nPreviously you were able to read 3 lines of the ad copy before you can click \"see more\". Now you have one line.\n\nIn the new body, you can only use 50 characters that can be seen in the ads before a person clicks to see more. \n\nThe headline still remains 40 characters; no changes have been made there.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nIt means meta is showing you where the focus should be put, and it's the CREATIVE.\n\nIt makes sense; people used to read long ad copies back in the day, but it seems like the shorter the ad copy is, the better it performs.\n\nI will put some ad examples in the comment sections, and some businesses will adopt them.\n\nIt seems like Meta is really bringing back the good old advertising days. You need to know how to create ad copy that captures your target audience's attention with just one line, and then the creative does the rest of the talking. \n\nI strongly believe we will see even more video ads running right now just because the messege is easier to deliver than in an image. \n\nIt does not mean that images will go away. I believe image ads are still the best way to test the advertising messege before you develop it in video ads. \n\nFor our team, we always start with images for every desire and ad angle that we test. The winning ad messeges are scripted out in the videos and developed there. \n\nFor those who want to ask what size ads we use, we mostly use 4:5 videos and 1:1 images. \n\nSummary\n\nIn order to make sure that meta pushes your ads to your target customer, focus on the first 50 characters in the body copy; it needs to grab customers' attention.\n\nCreative is now even more important than ever. Become really good at creating ads.\n\nI will add examples in the comment section. \n\nThanks for reading. See you in the next one.\n\nUpdate adding additional screenshots in the comment section on how the new body copy looks like. ",

    "title": "Case Study: Facebook Ads Scaling Strategies I Used to Make $125K Profit in 45 Days",
    "selftext": "Hey everyone, in this post I will share some techniques and strategies [I used to generate $125k in profit in 45 days. ](https://ibb.co/tK6C8Sy)This post is meant to be a follow up on[ my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAds/comments/1dy88jy/strategies_i_used_to_profitably_scale_from/) where I explain the strategies more in depth, so if you haven't read that start there. Below you will find a 6-week analysis including screenshots of the ad account.\n\n**Context:** Sports apparel niche. Targeting several countries. Breakeven ROAS is \\~1.65x\n\n# Week 1 (June 1 - June 7th): Start Noticing Signals to Scale\n\n* **Average daily spend**: £75/day\n* **Average ROAS:** 4.39x\n* **Campaign structure:**  2 campaigns (1 ASC+ and 1 MOF Retargeting)\n* **Link:** [**Screenshot**](https://ibb.co/rfzDtxx)\n\n**ASC+ campaign setup:** Super simple setup. 3 video creatives, 2 primary texts, 3 headlines, 1 description.  All adv+ creative enhancements turned off. Links to product catalog page. £50/day budget.\n\n**MOF Retargeting campaign setup:** My middle of funnel (MOF) retargeting campaign is targeting several countries, 220 day Facebook Engagers + 180 website visitors, no exclusions (re-purchasable product). I am using original audience options with advantage custom audience expansion turned off and adv+ placements. I am using the top 2 performing video creatives from the ASC+ campaign. £25/day budget.\n\nThese two campaigns had been running since May 19 and I noticed that my campaigns had the 2 key elements that I always look for when scaling: 1) consistent volume of sales and 2) ROAS that was well-above my breakeven. So I knew it was my time to start scaling.\n\n# Week 2 (June 8 - June 14th): Carefully Start Testing the Waters\n\n* **Average daily spend**: £118/day\n* **Average ROAS:** 5.55x\n* **Campaign structure:**  2 campaigns (1 ASC+ and 1 MOF Retargeting)\n* **Link:** [**Screenshot**](https://ibb.co/6ywHJbR)\n\nI left my retargeting campaign alone. I started to slowly vertically scale the ASC+ campaign around 25% every few days. After each budget increase I would watch the campaign closely to see if it would lose performance. I noticed that my ROAS was actually increasing with each scale, so I knew that I had a winner and needed to start scaling more aggressively. My next move was to start scaling via duplication.\n\n# Week 3 (June 15 - June 21st): New Offer, New Creative\n\n* **Average daily spend**: £145/day\n* **Average ROAS:** 4.68x\n* **Campaign structure:**  3 campaigns (2 ASC+ and 1 MOF Retargeting)\n* **Link:** [**Screenshot**](https://ibb.co/qd2nTFD)\n\nSince I knew ASC+ campaigns were working well on this ad account, I duplicated my original ASC+ campaign and replaced the creative with 5 new static images. Everything else about the ASC+ campaign remained the same.  £50/day budget. I left my other 2 campaigns completely untouched.\n\nAt this point, my client created a new 2-for-1 offer which was really well timed and a big hit. I noticed another lift in ROAS so I knew it was time to push further. Shoutout to my client who is always looking for ways to improve his business numbers on the back end which substantially help ad performance. His level of accountability and commitment to growing his business is incredible.\n\n# Week 4 (June 22 - June 28th): Start Duplicating\n\n* **Average daily spend**: £382/day\n* **Average ROAS:** 6.11x\n* **Campaign structure:**  7 campaigns (5 ASC+, 1 Crazy Method CBO and 1 MOF Retargeting)\n* **Link:** [**Screenshot**](https://ibb.co/PtJSJbd)\n\nMy client provided me with an excellent video creative that seemed like it had the potential to go viral. So I had them create a FB post and used the PostID to gather all the engagement in one post using ASC+. The post did really well and that campaign had an 11.12x ROAS.\n\nMy next move was to do another ASC+ campaign with the same 5 static creatives and expand into new countries. 5.76x\n\nSince the PostID was doing so well I decided to do a PostID Broad [Crazy Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9rXExuKwqw&amp;t=91s) at £300/day. Triple my normal budget. 4.83x\n\nThis whole time I was launching campaigns I was also vertically scaling larger budget campaigns by \\~20-30% every 2-4 days depending on the days performance and the 7-day average results.\n\n# Week 5 (June 29 - July 5): Stepping on the Gas\n\n* **Average daily spend**: £1,123/day\n* **Average ROAS:** 5.64x\n* **Campaign structure:**  7 campaigns (5 ASC+, 1 Crazy Method CBO and 1 MOF Retargeting)\n* **Link:** [**Screenshot**](https://ibb.co/4877swV)\n\nContinued vertically scaling throughout this period every 2-4 days. I also was optimizing ASC+ campaigns by closing any underperforming creatives to liberate the budget to the other ads. I also optimized the Crazy Method campaign by closing under performing ad sets and rebalancing budgets to maintain it's performance.\n\n# Week 6 (July 6 - July 15th): Found the Invisible Ceiling\n\n* **Average daily spend**: £1,983/day\n* **Average ROAS:** 4.31x\n* **Campaign structure:**  8 campaigns (5 ASC+, 1 Crazy Method CBO and 1 MOF Retargeting)\n* **Link:** [**Screenshot**](https://ibb.co/QbpShDz)\n\nDuplicated our best campaign as-is at £300/day. At this point, I hit an invisible ceiling of around £2,000/day where every time I would try to scale further, ROAS would drop substantially. I noticed ROAS starting to dip below where I was comfortable (4x) so I started lowering spends on campaigns that were underperforming compared to the rest.\n\n# Results\n\n* **Link:** [**Screenshot**](https://ibb.co/tK6C8Sy)\n\n# Where are we now?\n\nJune 1, 2024 to date we have spent £50,111.38 and generated \\~£216,476.70\\~ in revenue at a 4.32x return. Performance has dropped a bit in the last 7 days (3.84x on average) so I am systematically lowering / closing the lowest performing campaigns and keeping the best. My goal is to find the 'sweet spot' where I can keep a high spend and keep a decently high ROAS as well.\n\nThis is a big reason why I love to work with multiple campaigns. I have options. I can close and/or lower underperforming campaigns and keep the high ROAS campaigns. We are currently at £1,300/day now and I believe we will settle around £1,200/day for the next few weeks.\n\nMy goal is to keep as many evergreen campaigns as possible and keep our spend as high as possible so that we can scale like crazy during Q4. Once BFCM is over, we will settle our budgets back down to to a new baseline spend which is much higher than before. We will repeat this process again next year.\n\n# Key Takeaways\n\n* When you see consistent volume of sales &amp; ROAS well above breakeven, it's time to scale.\n* When it's time to scale, you should scale or others will.\n* Scale into new countries (if possible).\n* Scale using new offers.\n* Scale using new creatives.\n* Scale both horizontally &amp; vertically.\n* Scale by duplicating good performing campaigns as-is.\n* Scale by starting new campaigns at a much higher budget.\n* Scale via the Crazy Method.\n* Once you reach the point where ROAS consistently drops when you try to push further, try to find the 'sweet spot' just below that point and maintain higher spends as long as it makes sense.\n* Use BFCM as a way to scale way past what you normally would spend. Once it's over, settle back down to a higher baseline spend than what you would normally spend.\n\nThanks for reading!

    "title": "After being “in the trenches” of 20+ Facebook ad accounts the last few months, I’m back to share some must-know insights and my updated strategies.",
    "selftext": "Surprise, surprise. I’m back.\n\nIt’s been a while since my last post, at least a few months, and I’ve been very active and busy working with many Facebook ad accounts in many different capacities…\n\nWorking in them either by full-time management, conducting consulting calls or doing account audits… and for some people, all 3 of these services back to back to back.\n\nSome ad accounts spending as little as $50/day, some $300/day and others over $1,000/day.\n\nAnd in these last few months of intense work, I have made a lot of improvements in my approach to managing Facebook ads, optimizing, scaling and overall getting better results for my clients.\n\nFor those who are familiar with my work, I say that I am most known for my capture-nurture-convert campaign structure.\n\nThis campaign structure in a nutshell: 1 campaign is for growing your custom audience with high-quality data using 3 second video views exclusions (capture), a 2nd campaign for retargeting (nurture), and at times a 3rd campaign if narrowed retargeting with high-intent CTAs/offers (convert).\n\n**Here is a post I wrote a couple of years ago going into more detail on my campaign structure that is STILL getting people results today -** [https://www.reddit.com/r/digital\\_marketing/comments/10z6dvv/ive\\_been\\_running\\_the\\_same\\_profitable\\_campaign/](https://www.reddit.com/r/digital_marketing/comments/10z6dvv/ive_been_running_the_same_profitable_campaign/)\n\nThis \\^ post has the campaign structure that I still use to this day as my campaign launch structure for new clients. \n\nI’ve been using the same launch campaign for years, and let it run for 5 to 7 days.\n\nWhat has changed for me in the last few months is what I do after the initial week 1 (weeks 2, 3, 4 and beyond of managing a new Facebook ad account).\n\nAnd what I am doing beyond week 1 is what I am going to share in this post.\n\nSo, if you need help with how to launch Facebook campaigns, view the link from a few lines above. \n\nIf you want my latest strategies and learnings on optimizing and scaling that go beyond the launch, then keep reading.\n\nThere are 4 things I will go into detail about in this post about my updated strategies.\n\n**1 - Establishing the ad account behavior profile**\n\n**2 - Doing accelerated macro testing**\n\n**3 - Campaign diversification &amp; “meta” shift**\n\n**4 - Leveraging Advantage+ earlier**\n\nWith the first 2 topics, I want to define them first because there is some overlap.\n\n**Ad account behavior:** The way that an ad account responds and reacts when specific changes are made to it.\n\n**Macro testing:** Tests that are conducted in an ad account that are testing elements that are more likely to see big changes made in results.\n\nNow I’ll go deeper into each topic one at a time as it relates to the changes I’ve made to my post-week 1 Facebook campaign management process.\n\n# 1 - Establishing the ad account behavior profile\n\nWhen I manage an ad account full time, I need to quickly establish and make note of as many of the ad account behaviors so that I know what to do when I encounter certain situations. That way I have a complete profile of that ad account’s behavior.\n\nThe reason that I need to do this is due to one main fact: all ad accounts are different.\n\nIf you take two ad accounts and make the same changes on them, you will most likely see different results from them. The way you scale on one ad account compared to the other is different and is all based on ad account behavior.\n\nFor example: When a campaign is performing well, one ad account might respond well to a 40% increase in budget, while another will tank if I change even 10%. Understanding these nuances in the first few weeks is key to scaling successfully with each ad account.\n\nI cannot assume that if something works for one ad account that it is guaranteed to work for another.\n\nMost of the Facebook ad questions I see people ask all have the answer in the same place: the ad account’s behavior profile.\n\n*“How should I scale a campaign?”*\n\nThe ad account behavior profile tells you the best way to scale that has worked previously in this ad account.\n\n*“What type of campaign should I launch for an upcoming sale?”*\n\nAd account behavior profile…\n\n*“How long should I let a campaign run for?”*\n\nAd account behavior profile…\n\n*“What do I do if I see a drop in performance in a campaign that was working well last month?”*\n\nAd account behavior profile…\n\n*“Should I do interest targeting or lookalike?”*\n\nAd account behavior profile…\n\n*“How should I…”*\n\nAd account behavior profile…\n\nEtc, etc, etc.\n\nAd account behavior is something that I’ve always been aware of but in recent months I’ve put in more effort to test out as many elements of the ad account as possible to determine what works and what doesn’t for it. \n\nI have also started making note of what changes were made and the impact in results after making changes to the ad account. Using the example given above with changing the budget directly on the campaign, if that makes the campaign stop performing then I will put in my notes for that ad account “Don’t scale with budget increase on campaign” to their ad account behavior profile.\n\nThe ad account behavior profile is more effectively established when you make macro-level changes and perform macro-level tests on it.\n\nLet’s talk about macro-level testing now.\n\n# 2 - Doing accelerated macro testing\n\nA change that I’ve made to my process of managing Facebook ad accounts is how quickly I test out macro-level elements. This helps me not only establish a more detailed ad account profile, it also allows me to find the most profitable setup for the ad account.\n\nWhat I do for campaign launches has been the same for 4 years. But what I am doing now for the first, second, third and beyond of the weekly changes/optimizations has changed in order to find the most profitable setup in as short of time as possible.\n\nTo establish the difference between macro and small changes, a macro change would be going from interest targeting to Advantage+ and a small change would be modifying a headline from “Elevate Your Style - The Cozy Sweater” to “Elevate Your Style With The Cozy Sweater”. \n\nChange 1: Interest targeting to Advantage+\n\nResults: I have seen as much as a 50% change in cost per acquisition with a change like this, therefore it would be a macro-level change.\n\nChange 2: “Elevate Your Style - The Cozy Sweater” to “Elevate Your Style With The Cozy Sweater”\n\nResults: The headline is basically the same, so I would estimate a 0.01% change in results.\n\nMaking changes that result in as much as 50% increase/decrease in performance is much more efficient to focus on than trying to make optimizations at 0.01% at a time.\n\nThat means the changes I am making now are meant to have big impacts to the results rather than small optimizations for small impact. It’s \n\nWhat I’m doing differently these days is making as many of these types of tests in an ad account in as short of time as possible. Hence the “accelerated” part of it.\n\nDoing accelerated macro testing does make things with budget more complicated. If a client is only able to spend $100/day, then that is less macro tests that can be conducted at the same time. Each test will require $50 to $200/day in ad spend and at times you will need to turn off a campaign in order to conduct a new test. \n\nIn an ideal situation, you would be able to run 10 different campaigns at $50 to $200/day each to establish the most profitable campaign setup very fast.\n\nHowever, what can happen when you have budget constraints while conducting accelerated macro testing is like this… let’s say you have 3 campaigns running:\n\n1 - Interest campaign - $100/day\n\n2 - Retargeting campaign - $40/day\n\n3 - Advantage+ campaign - $60/day\n\nTotal: $200/day\n\nAnd you want to test out a lookalike audience campaign, but your budget is $200/day, which you’ve already reached max available budget. In this situation, you could turn off the interest campaign at $100/day, then launch a lookalike campaign at $100/day. \n\nThe downside of this is, what if the lookalike audience performs way worse than the interest targeting? You would have wished you left that interest campaign on.\n\nThere are about 10 macro tests that I try to conduct for new clients. Here are some of the main tests that I attempt to do for new clients as quickly as possible:\n\n* Interest targeting\n* Advantage+\n* Warm stacked audiences\n* Manual bid\n\nSometimes we can’t get through all of the macro tests in the allotted amount of time due to budget constraints and ad account behavior issues. But what I don’t want to do is spend the entire time working on an ad account only testing out different interest targeting options instead of making multiple macro tests.\n\n# 3 - Campaign diversification &amp; “meta” shift\n\nI’ve mentioned and gone into detail on the concept of campaign diversification in posts that I’ve written in the past.\n\nThe short explanation of campaign diversification is just to have a variety in the types of campaigns you have in an account (obviously it requires a high available daily ad spend budget to implement this) so that when one type of campaign stops working, you have others to offset performance.\n\nWhat I am seeing in recent months is certain profitable campaign types will completely stop working for a while and then a few weeks later they start performing well again.\n\nIf you play online video games where there are changes to the stats of equipment and/or weapons, you may be familiar with the concept of “the meta” for a video game. Basically it’s like if the developers of Pokemon Go decided to make Pikachu really strong for a few months during a season, then Pikachu would be considered “meta” for that season because the changes made to it makes it strong. Call of Duty does the same thing with guns, and there are times where guns can become meta again, then not meta, then get another update and it’s meta again, etc.\n\nThe same thing happens with what’s working with Facebook ad accounts where there’s a shift in the standard, or “meta”, every once in a while.\n\nKeeping diversity in ad accounts helps with being very proactive when for example all of your interest targeting campaigns drop, you turn them off and scale up lookalike audiences or whatever is still working.\n\nBut in addition to that, realizing that just because something stops working doesn’t mean it won’t ever work again.\n\nOne of the campaigns I’ve been managing for the majority of this year, we started with interest targeting campaigns and saw really good results. Eventually those campaigns were outperformed by Advantage+, so I shifted focus on those.\n\nBut recently I decided to try interest targeting again for the first time in 5 months. The first day of running that campaign it got a 7x ROAS. Which is a good sign that interest targeting is most likely meta again for this ad account.\n\nWrapping up this section about campaign diversification and meta shift, basically another way to look at these shifts in what’s working and what’s not in a Facebook ad account can be tied to something discussed earlier in this post, ad account behavior profile. The meta changing is nothing more than the small changes to your ad account behavior profile. This diversity helps ensure that when one type of campaign type/ad style,etc stops working, you have others to rely on. Don’t get too attached to a single ‘meta.’ Stay flexible.\n\n# 4 - Leveraging Advantage+ earlier\n\nAdvantage+ these days is basically the same as broad targeting when that became popular a couple of years ago.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nTo be completely honest, in my own experience I always believed that broad targeting was way overhyped and just a way for YouTube channels to get views from people looking for a new hack. In the rare cases that broad targeting would work for me at all were in ad accounts that had thousands of conversions in it, and even then I would see better results with interest targeting and lookalike.\n\nWhen Advantage+ originally came out, I initially thought that it was going to be the same as broad targeting. I tried Advantage+ a couple of times early on in its release and split tested it with interest targeting and/or interest targeting. Didn’t see much difference, so I dismissed it early on.\n\nEventually I came around to Advantage+. I tested it again in my healthy and active ad accounts and it started to outperform all other campaign types in some instances.\n\nHowever, what I am seeing in recent months that I didn’t think would happen is that I am starting to see Advantage+ work well, even in nearly brand new ad accounts.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, broad targeting I only saw work well with ad accounts that had a lot of conversions. Advantage+ is something different and much better because of its potential to work in brand new ad accounts.\n\nI’ve only had the opportunity to test out Advantage+ on new-ish ad accounts only a couple of times where it worked. The interesting thing is that these were very niche products, one that you would think you’d need super specific interests targeting to work. These weren't basic or universally used products like shoes or backpacks where you would assume Facebook’s AI technology would be easily able to easily analyze the copy and creative and determine what your product is and determine who to show your ads to.\n\nSo the change that I am making these days is that I test Advantage+ as a source of cold traffic very early when managing an ad account, typically week 2 or 3, and sometimes at campaign launch if budget allows… without waiting for an ad account to get a few hundred conversions/purchases like I would for broad targeting.\n\nIf you’ve been holding back on using Advantage+ in newer accounts, now’s the time to give it a try. It may surprise you, as it has with my clients.\n\nHowever, I still believe campaign diversification is very important when experimenting with Advantage+ campaigns. Because sometimes I see all of my Advantage+ campaigns stop working and we are back to interest targeting like it’s 2015.\n\nAnd that will conclude what I’ve learned in these past few months and changes to my approach with Facebook ads. Hope you found it helpful and gained some insights from it. Thanks for reading.",

    "title": "why facebook ads are flopping right now (from a $1.2 million per month ad account)",
    "selftext": "As the title says, I just crossed $1.2 million per month in ad spend (mostly for local small businesses and a couple of national e-comm and affiliate network accounts) across my clients' accounts, and I wanted to share why there’s so much uncertainty with Facebook ads right now.\n\nThe issue with election season is that it overlaps with the start of the holiday season as well as Q4 end-of-year liquidation. This means large spenders (politicians, corporations, etc.) are maxing out their budgets, and their audiences naturally overlap with most niches. This usually leads to higher customer acquisition costs for small businesses or at least it has in my 11 years as a facebook marketer.\n\nLast time this happened, I saw a big ROAS increase toward the end of December. Can't say for sure it’ll happen again, but we might see things return to normal around then.\n\nWith all that said, here’s what I’m seeing across various sectors:\n\n**Local Services**: My chiros, medspas, holistic, and aesthetic clients are mostly slow with certain regions doing well. Wedding services, personal trainers, photographers are doing really well (profitable ads/good sales months). \n\n**Agencies:** graphic/web/software developers, marketers, high-ticket service providers, are doing really well\n\n**E-commerce**: Low-ticket, non-proprietary, dropshippers, and highly competitive e-comm ads (physical goods) are seeing a huge drop in ROAS right now. This group seems to get hit the hardest during tough times.\n\n**Course Creators &amp; Coaches**: Small niche course sellers, online fitness coaches, real estate etc. are booming.\n\n**Insurance**: Insurance agency owners are booming, but franchise brokers are slow (**strange**).\n\n**Home Services**: Residential architects and other home services (electricians, trades) are mixed.\n\n**Affiliate Media Buyers**: experiencing some challenges. \n\n**Finance**: My long-standing finance brands are stable, while smaller finance brands are seeing growth slowdowns and lower ROAS.\n\nHere’s some additional rambling for you, for whatever it’s worth:\n\nI’ve been running ads on Facebook for 11 years. Facebook has consistently had winning seasons and challenging seasons throughout that time. One thing is certain: it has never been fully consistent, so don’t expect it to be.\n\nI wouldn’t try to scale right now in this climate unless your ads are doing well. Rather, appreciate the slowdown and work on other parts of your business.\n\nDuring these times, I like to spend extra time on SpyFu, [Foreplay.co](http://Foreplay.co), the ads library, YouTube, Reddit, and just study. \n\nOrganic content is also saving the season for many of my accounts. For clients who make content, it’s been a solid way to offset ad costs. Ads have high and low seasons. \n\n**Disclaimer**: These are just my observations based on my accounts and experience—take them with a grain of salt.",

    "title": "I reverse-engineered my competitor's ad strategy using only free tools (and went from $8K to $43K/month)",
    "selftext": "I'm sitting at my kitchen table at 2 AM, third night in a row, watching my Shopify dashboard like it's going to magically fix itself.\n\nMy store? Selling minimalist leather wallets. Revenue?\n\nA pathetic $8,000/month. Meanwhile, there's this guy - let's call him Marcus; absolutely printing money in the same niche. I know because I've been obsessively checking the Meta Ad Library every single day like a psychopath.\n\nHis ads are EVERYWHERE. Meta, Google, YouTube. And I'm thinking... how the hell is he doing this? I'm burning $2,000/month on ads and barely breaking even. He's clearly spending 10x that and thriving.\n\nSo I did something that changed everything. I became a stalker. A legal, ethical stalker. But a stalker nonetheless.\n\n**The Breakdown That Started It All**\n\nIt started innocently enough. I searched his brand in Meta's Ad Library (you know, that free tool Meta provides that nobody actually uses properly). He was running 47 active ads. FORTY-SEVEN.\n\nBut here's what broke my brain: they weren't just random ads. There was a *pattern*.\n\nAll his Meta ads had this emotional, lifestyle vibe:\n\n* \"Your grandfather carried a wallet that lasted 40 years. Yours won't survive 40 days.\"\n* Videos of wallets being thrown, sat on, dragged behind cars\n* Before/After shots of bulky wallets vs. his slim ones\n* User-generated content with real customers\n\nThen I checked Google (yeah, you can spy on Google Ads too—I'll explain how). His search ads were COMPLETELY different:\n\n* \"Minimalist Wallet RFID Blocking | Free Shipping\"\n* \"Best Slim Wallet 2025 - 4.8★ Rating\"\n* \"Leather Wallet - Ships Today | $59\"\n\nSame product. Same company. Totally different approach.\n\n**Meta = Emotion. Google = Transaction.**\n\nAnd that's when it hit me. I was running the SAME boring product ads on both platforms. I was basically screaming \"BUY MY WALLET\" everywhere, while Marcus was playing 4D chess.\n\n# The Free Tools That Changed My Game\n\nLet me break down exactly how I did this, because this is the part nobody talks about:\n\n# Step 1: The Meta Ad Library Deep Dive\n\nEveryone knows about Meta's Ad Library, but they use it wrong. They look at one ad and move on. Here's what I did:\n\nI opened a Google Sheet and spent 4 hours (yeah, four hours) logging EVERY single one of Marcus's ads:\n\n* Ad copy (first 3 lines, full copy, CTA)\n* Creative type (image, video, carousel, UGC)\n* Date first seen (Ad Library shows this)\n* Landing page URL\n* Offer mentioned (20% off, free shipping, bundle deal, etc.)\n\nI created columns for everything. Then I started seeing patterns:\n\n* He ran emotional \"problem-solution\" ads Mon-Wed\n* Weekend ads were all UGC and social proof\n* End of month? Always a sale/urgency angle\n* He had 6 different landing pages depending on the ad angle\n\n***Time invested: 4 hours***  \n***Cost: $0***  \n***Value: Literally priceless***\n\n# Step 2: The Google Ads Reverse Engineering\n\nThis one's sneakier. You can't just \"see\" someone's Google Ads like Meta. But you can get pretty damn close:\n\n**Method 1: Manual Search** I opened an incognito window and searched every possible keyword:\n\n* \"minimalist wallet\"\n* \"slim leather wallet\"\n* \"RFID blocking wallet\"\n* \"best wallet for men\"\n* \"thin wallet\"\n\nEvery time his ad showed up, I screenshot it. Noted the headline, description, extensions, landing page URL. I did this across 30+ keywords.\n\n**Method 2: The URL Trick** His landing pages had UTM parameters (those ?utm\\_source things at the end of URLs). I could literally see:\n\n* utm\\_source=google or facebook\n* utm\\_campaign=search-brand or search-competitor\n* utm\\_content=headline-variant-1\n\nHe was basically showing me his entire campaign structure in the URL. Amateur mistake on his part. Lucky break for me.\n\n**Method 3: SEMrush Free Trial** Look, SEMrush is expensive. But they give you 7 days free. I signed up, dumped his entire domain into it, and exported:\n\n* Every keyword he was bidding on\n* His estimated ad spend\n* His actual ad copy variations\n* His top-performing landing pages\n\nI cancelled before the trial ended. Downloaded everything to Google Sheets.\n\n**Time invested: 6 hours**  \n**Cost: $0**  \n**Ethics: Questionable but totally legal**\n\n# Step 3: The Landing Page Teardown\n\nThis is where I went full detective mode.\n\nI visited every single one of his landing pages and used:\n\n* **BuiltWith** (free browser extension) - showed me his tech stack, pixels, apps\n* **WhatFont** (free extension) - told me his exact fonts\n* **ColorZilla** (free extension) - grabbed his color codes\n* **View Page Source** \\- checked his meta descriptions, structured data, hidden pixels\n\nI literally recreated his pages in a Google Doc with screenshots and notes:\n\n* Headline structure\n* Value proposition placement\n* Social proof location\n* CTA button copy and colors\n* Trust badges used\n* Exit intent popup offers\n\nI noticed something INSANE: His Google Ads traffic went to pages with:\n\n* Comparison charts (his wallet vs 4 competitors)\n* Detailed specs and materials\n* Shipping/return info above the fold\n* Price justification sections\n\nHis Meta Ads traffic went to pages with:\n\n* Large lifestyle images\n* Customer testimonials videos\n* \"The Story Behind Our Wallets\" section\n* Minimal text, maximum emotion\n\n**He was literally sending different traffic to different experiences based on platform psychology.**\n\n# Step 4: The Creative Swipe File System\n\nI created a folder structure on Google Drive:\n\n    Competitors/\n    ├── Marcus_Brand/\n    │   ├── Meta_Ads/\n    │   │   ├── 2024-10-Oct/\n    │   │   ├── 2024-11-Nov/\n    │   │   └── 2024-12-Dec/\n    │   ├── Google_Ads/\n    │   ├── Landing_Pages/\n    │   └── Email_Captures/\n    ├── Competitor_2/\n    └── Competitor_3/\n\nEvery week, I'd spend 30 minutes screenshotting new ads, updating my tracker, and looking for patterns.\n\nI started noticing:\n\n* When he launched new products (ad volume spiked)\n* What creative angles got repeated (if he ran it for 3+ weeks, it was working)\n* His seasonal pivots (Father's Day, Black Friday angles appeared weeks early in testing)\n\n# The \"Holy Shit\" Moment\n\nAfter 3 weeks of tracking, I had enough data to spot something nobody talks about:\n\n**Marcus would test an angle on Google first (cheaper clicks, faster data), then roll out winners to Meta.**\n\nFor example:\n\n* Week 1: Google ad headline \"Finally, A Wallet That Actually Fits In Your Pocket\"\n* Week 3: Same angle appears in Meta ads as \"Tired of bulky wallets ruining your pants?\"\n* Week 4: Full Meta campaign rollout with video creative using that angle\n\nHe was using Google as his testing ground, then amplifying winners on Meta where he could build brand.\n\nMind. Blown.\n\n# What I Actually Did With This Info\n\nI didn't copy Marcus. That's stupid and obvious. Instead, I found the GAPS:\n\n1. **He wasn't targeting women buyers** (wallets as gifts). I made that my Meta angle.\n2. **His Google ads never mentioned sustainability**. My wallets were vegetable-tanned leather. I owned that keyword cluster.\n3. **He focused on minimalism, I focused on durability**. Different angle, same outcome.\n4. **His landing pages loaded slowly** (BuiltWith showed he had 17 apps installed). Mine were faster. I made speed my competitive advantage.\n\nI basically used his playbook but zipped left while he zigged right.\n\n# The Results (Because That's Why You're Still Reading)\n\n***Month 1 after implementing:***\n\n* Revenue: $8K → $14K\n* Ad spend: $2K → $2.8K\n* ROAS: 2.1 → 3.4\n\n***Month 3:***\n\n* Revenue: $31K\n* Ad spend: $6.2K\n* ROAS: 5.0\n\n***Month 6 (last month):***\n\n* Revenue: $43K\n* Ad spend: $8.1K\n* ROAS: 5.3\n\nMore importantly, I understood WHY things worked instead of just guessing.\n\n# The Free Toolkit I Built (And Why I'm Sharing It)\n\nLook, I'm not a guru. I'm just a Shopify owner who got obsessive. But I built something that literally changed my business, and honestly? More people should know this exists.\n\nI created what I call **\"The Competitive Intelligence Toolkit\"** \\- basically everything I used to reverse-engineer Marcus and 4 other competitors:\n\n**1. The Competitor Tracking Spreadsheet**\n\n* Pre-built Google Sheet template with formulas\n* Tracks Meta ads, Google ads, landing pages, offers over time\n* Auto-calculates competitor ad frequency and creative refresh rates\n* Includes a \"pattern recognition\" tab that I update weekly\n\n**2. Ad Library Scraping Instructions**\n\n* Step-by-step guide for documenting competitor ads efficiently\n* Chrome extension recommendations\n* Screenshot annotation techniques I use\n* How to spot test ads vs. scaled campaigns\n\n**3. The Creative Swipe File System**\n\n* Folder structure template\n* Naming conventions that actually make sense\n* Tagging system for quick retrieval\n* How to analyze creative patterns monthly\n\n**4. Landing Page Teardown Template**\n\n* Checklist I use for every competitor page\n* Tools list with video tutorials\n* Conversion element tracker\n* A/B test hypothesis generator\n\n**5. Weekly Competitive Analysis Protocol**\n\n* My exact Monday morning routine (takes 45 mins/week)\n* What to track, what to ignore\n* How to spot shifts in competitor strategy\n* When to update your own campaigns based on market moves\n\n**6. Screenshot Annotation Guide**\n\n* How I mark up ads for insights\n* Tools I use (all free)\n* Organizing insights for your team\n* Creating \"insight decks\" for strategy sessions\n\n**The Stuff Nobody Tells You**\n\nThis isn't some magic bullet. Here's what actually happened:\n\n* First 2 weeks: Felt like I was wasting time. Saw no immediate results.\n* Week 3: Started seeing patterns but didn't know what to do with them.\n* Week 4-6: Tested new approaches, half failed completely.\n* Week 7: First real winner emerged (a Meta ad angle I found from a competitor's test).\n* Month 3: Finally had enough data to make this systematic.\n\nIt's not sexy. It's repetitive. But it works.\n\nAlso, some hard truths:\n\n* You need at least 3 competitors to track (more data = better patterns)\n* This works best if you're spending $1K+/month on ads (need budget to test learnings)\n* You still need to understand ad fundamentals (this isn't a replacement for skill)\n* Some competitors are smarter than others (pick good ones to study)\n\n**Why I'm Posting This**\n\nHonestly? Because 6 months ago I would've paid $500 for someone to just TELL me this was possible.\n\nI wasted months doing \"ad creative research\" (for my Whop digital products and Shopify products) by watching YouTube videos and buying $97 courses that taught me nothing. When the answer was literally sitting there, free, in public databases.\n\nIf you're a Shopify store owner grinding it out, burning money on ads, watching competitors lap you... this is your permission slip to become a (legal) stalker.\n\nThe big brands do this with $50K/year spy tools. You can do 80% of it with free tools and 5 hours a week.",

    "title": "My Team Tested 804 Ad Creatives In The Last 2 Months -  Here Are Some Creative Concepts That Performed The Best. ",
    "selftext": "Good day, Redditors!\n\nI made a lot of posts about the importance of creative testing and thought to share the creative concepts that we have tested and that worked for most of the brands ( our brands and our client brands) in the past two months.\n\nI really hope that you can look at the concepts and test them for your brands. It's not if they work they all work it's how well you created them.\n\nLet's get into it.\n\n# 1) All In One Image Ad\n\nHere is an example from AG1 ( the example the image is turned into a video)  - [Click Here](https://ibb.co/QM9tFNh)\n\nWe call this all in one ad because there is everything that you want to have in one ad.\n\n1. Calling out clear desire (especially in this example. The customer desire is highlighted in a review.\n2. Credibility - showing the review + how many stars they get\n3. Shows benefits in a feature disguise.\n4. Intriguing offer FREE\\*\\* Welcome Kit\n5. Ad copy matches the creative messege.\n\nWe use similar creatives for our own and clients' brands as well, especially in the supplement, skincare, lingerie, clothing, and tech niches. This type of ad concept can be applied to almost every brand.\n\nI like the one ad image concept cause it delivers all the necessary information. For our cases, videos have mostly been our longest-running ads because the video can deliver all the information that is required for the potential customer in order to spark interest in our product.\n\nWith images, it has always been hard until we tested all in one image concept. We started to test this concept three months ago, it took a while until we nailed it, but once we did, this concept has been top 4 highest spending and longest running ad.\n\n# 2) POV YOUR DAY AD\n\nHere is an example from AG1 -  [Click Here](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/UNRgoXEHMxeJT8zgp9qB?user=eCOMHUB)\n\nThese type of POV ads that start with \"Here is my daily routine to ( insert desire \"How I keep myself energized\", insert a problem solution \"how I deal with \"problem\" ) \"work like crazy. They feel native to the platform since someone is recording their day or just sharing their secrets on how they solve x problem.\n\nThis ad has everything in it\n\n1. Calls out the morning routine - everyone has one.\n2. Calls out other products people use that are harder to consume with pills( need to open a lot of bottles, place it back, etc)\n3. It gives feedback about the taste - a lot of green supplements taste like sh\\*\\*.\n4. Informs about their current offer (it's not a discount, it's a value offer, customers who get this now receive x and x and x )\n\n# 3) BEFORE &amp; AFTER AI ADS\n\nHere is an example of an ad from obvi health - [Click here](https://app.foreplay.co/share/ads/O9OHkLPevG1JpOeevLWA?user=eCOMHUB)\n\nThis ad is amazing:\n\n1. Easy to create - you can create 20 ads in 10 minutes using AI.\n2. Shows and calls out the existing target audience's feelings and situation.\n3. It shows the transformation that can be achieved with emotion ( how the customer will feel)  and what they can expect ( weight loss, feeling more energized, improved physical appearance).\n\nThese three winning concepts have worked for us and our clients in the past 2 months.\n\nNow, about the part about how to create these ads. This ad concepts are created with a lot of research behind them. Here are the things that we do on weekly basis.\n\n* Go through our ad comments to find (great reviews and new mechanisms for new audiences that we didn't think about)\n* Our product reviews - to search for great stories about how we solved x desire\n* We search YouTube for reviews about our competitors to find what people say about them, both good and bad; we also leverage the bad in our ads.\n* Look for competitor ads and break down their longest-running ads with their hooks, asking ourselves ( why are they calling out this problem, why they present the messaging in this way, etc.) We don't like to copy our competitors, but look at their ads for inspiration and say it differently or explain how we can use certain messaging in our own ads.\n* We research recent competitor reviews and look for 1-2 star ratings. You can find a lot of gold there.\n* We send customer surveys, which we get a lot of feedback and good ad ideas for.\n* We call our most frequent customers and ask for a 10-minute interview in exchange for a special gift from us.\n\nDoing these things thas helped us find winning ad concepts that we can test and scale.\n\nTry these ads for yourself, especially the AI ones, since they are easy to create and implement.\n\nHopefully, you found this post valuable. I would love to hear your thoughts about the creative examples and how you would implement them.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nSee you in the next one.",
