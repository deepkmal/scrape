    "selftext": "YouTube marketing can be defined as the process of promoting a company and its products on the YouTube platform by uploading quality videos to a company’s YouTube channel.\n\nVideo content is the secret to successful content marketing.\n\nBeing successful on YouTube takes planning. Here are some easy steps that are a good place to start.\n\n**Research Keywords**\n\nUse YouTube's Keyword Tool to find popular searches within your space. Optimizing your digital media content for search is just as important as it is for your written content on a blog or website.\n\n**Know your competition**\n\nSearch on YouTube to find other videos that already rank well for the keywords that you would like to rank for. See what it is that you are up against and seek out strategies to out-do them.\n\nThis phase should also help you in your keyword research. Use this research to look into some opportunities that your competitors may not be taking advantage of.\n\n**Create a kick-ass video**\n\nYou don't just create viral content because you want to. Viral content - unless it happens by chance - must be well thought-out and gripping! The most shareable content happens naturally, not intentionally.\n\nThis may sound counterintuitive, but sticking true to your brand and designing digital content that has a purpose for your specific audience will be informative and engaging.\n\n**Fill out your video details**\n\nAlways keep in mind your standard SEO practices when it comes to posting your finished product. Make sure all of the necessary fields are filled and focused on the targeted keywords.\n\nPut important keywords at the front of your video titles, and include them in your description and tags. Do not overdo it, just put keywords that are relevant and are backed up by your research.\n\n**Use the \"Featured Videos\" section**\n\nIf you are certain that your video will be a major hit, use YouTube's paid \"Featured Videos\" service to get your video seen by many people in a short amount of time.\n\nOnce the video takes off, your organic traffic will usually out-do your paid traffic. Just as you can pay to increase your chances of coming up when people search for you on Google, you can up your odds with your videos as well.\n\n**Insert links in your videos**\n\nUse annotations to insert links to other videos to maximize every viewer. These can pop up throughout the video and lead audiences to another video, or even your website and blog. However, do not overdo this either. Make sure that annotations do not impede the viewing experience.\n\nIf you have one video that you want to concentrate on driving views too, use YouTube's InVideo Programming to add a featured video overlay. Also, make sure to include a branding watermark so that people can easily navigate to your YouTube page.\n\nThere is a lot of potential that lies within just one video when it comes to additional navigation options. Analyze which ones would make the most sense for your business, and be sure to take advantage of them.\n\n**Interact with high-value users**\n\nFind users on YouTube who are active and adding value through their participation in the social network. Get your video in front of them - without spamming so that they can do part of the work for you.\n\nYour video will also benefit with more traffic thanks to increased comments. YouTube will soon be implementing new features to increase the amount of social interaction on the website (for example by making it easier to find your friends)\n\n**Use social media**\n\nWith built-up and relevant social media accounts, get your video seen by more people. By \"relevant\" I mean that your friends and your user history should be somehow related to the topic of your video for it to get more qualified traffic.\n\nMy favorite sites for video sharing are Digg, Twitter, and StumbleUpon. Now that Google+ is integrated into YouTube it is fairly simple to reach out to people who might enjoy your content.\n\n**Rinse, wash, repeat**\n\nGo back and start over. Look at what you can improve about your video production and continue to keep your video channel page fresh with more videos! To learn how YouTube counts video views check out this previous blog post.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThere are many top YouTube marketing applications but choosing the right one can be difficult.\n\nYou need to choose an application that is not only affordable but also feature-rich. Keeping this in mind, here is the best YouTube marketing application for you Traffic Jeet!\n\nIt’s an amazing 6-in-one app that will do everything for you related to YouTube marketing.\n\nI hope this helps! :)",

    "title": "I spent 4 Days Reading 32+ Marketing Reports. Here’s What I learned (Part-1)",
    "selftext": "\n\n#1. Insights Regarding Video Marketing \n\n* 96% of marketers believe optimal length for a marketing video is under 10 minutes.

The response from CMOs regarding Impact on Marketing Tools &amp; Customer Service is neutral as the it will take time to impact the usage of new tools. Also, their current marketing tools in usage are implementing AI slowly, making the decision of shift to new tools harder. \n\n#3. How Consumers Behaviour is Changing \n\n1. People want brands to show they listen 93% of them believe that brands should react to public opinion. (2023, ruderfinn) \n2. Why Consumers are abandoning purchases: 37% limited payment options, other 37% due to poor navigation and layout. With 33% leaving due to slow speed. (2022, storyblok)\n3.

Social Media Engagement is Dropping \n\n* Instagram engagement rates across all industries fell by 30% last year. \n* Tweeting frequency was also down by 20% &amp; engagement rate growth was flat for Twitter. \n* Comparing to Post frequencies, Tiktok is still at the bottom.

My Key Insights from Advertising Research on Brand Awareness \n\n1. In her study of the U.S. personal computer industry, Sovinsky Goeree finds that traditional demand models overstate price elasticities because they assume that consumers are aware of – and hence choose among – all brands in the market when in actuality most consumers are aware of only a small fraction of brands.\n2. How Advertising Patterns &amp; Practices deliver signals to Consumers can positively shape perceptions about the quality of the brand. The more volatile and inconsistent a brand’s advertising pattern is, the less impact it’s advertising expenditures will have on perceived quality.\n3. Our main finding is that advertising expenditures have a significant positive effect on brand awareness but no significant effect on perceived quality. These results appear to be robust across a wide range of specifications. Since awareness is the most basic kind of information a consumer can have for a brand, we con- clude that an important role of advertising is information provision. On the other hand, our results indicate that advertising is not likely to alter consumers’ quality perceptions.\n\n**You can [subscribe here](https://jaskaransaini.com/thesocialjuice/) to receive marketing reports &amp; news every week for free, with no BS.**",

    "title": "How much testing is too much? When do you stop tweaking and just roll with what works?",
    "selftext": "I run a small eco-friendly kitchen product store, and when I first started doing email marketing, I had no idea what a \"good\" open rate was. I’d hear people mention 20% and think, “Is that good or bad?”\n\nFrom what I’ve learned, a typical open rate for most industries is between 15-25%. For an e-commerce business like mine, hitting around 20% is solid, but I wanted to do better.\n\nAt first, my open rates were pretty disappointing—around 10%. So, I started making a few changes to improve things. Here’s what worked for me:\n\n1. **Clean Your Email List -** I use **Warpleads** to export unlimited leads, and **Millionverifier** to check if those email addresses are valid. If your list is full of bad emails, your open rates will tank. Cleaning it up was the first step.\n2. **Make It Personal -** At first, I sent generic emails, and they didn’t do well. Now, I try to personalize them—like addressing people by name and offering tips or sneak peeks, not just product promotions.\n3. **Timing is Key  -** I also figured out that sending emails on Tuesdays or Thursdays around 10 AM worked best for my audience. It took some testing, but finding the right time made a big difference.\n4. **Subject Lines Matter -** I realized my subject lines were boring. Instead of “New Products In Store,” I tried something like “Want a Greener Kitchen?” It felt more engaging and helped boost my open rates.\n\nAfter 3 months of tweaking things, my open rate went up to about 22%. It wasn’t instant, but it definitely paid off. I’m just at the point wherein I’m not sure if I’m over-testing them. How much testing is too much? When do you stop tweaking and just roll with what works? At this point, I’m hitting a solid 20%, but I feel like I could still do better.",

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been working as a virtual assistant for a small e-commerce store. Our main outreach was social media marketing, mostly live selling. But ever since we added new products and expanded, we looked for more channels for outreach. So we started to do email marketing.\n\nFor a while, our email campaigns weren’t performing as well as we hoped. Our open rates were stagnant, and conversions were lagging. I knew we needed to make some serious changes to turn things around.\n\nHere’s what we did:\n\n* **WarpLeads**: I used their unlimited export leads feature to build a more targeted list. This helped us reach a more relevant audience.\n* **Reoon**: We verified our email addresses to ensure our list was clean and engaged.\n* **Maildoso**: Managed our email campaigns with better infrastructure to improve delivery and performance.\n\nWith these adjustments, we crafted more personalized content and set up targeted campaigns. **Our engagement rates shot up by 45%**, and we saw a noticeable increase in sales.\n\nFor those of you in e-commerce, what strategies have you found effective for revitalizing email campaigns?\n\nLooking forward to your insights!",
