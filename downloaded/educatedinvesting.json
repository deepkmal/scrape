But capital does not care about your loyalty or your vote; it only cares about the bottom line. Trump's populism was always an aesthetic, not an economic plan, and now Lexington is paying the price for buying into the grift.\n\nEither way, this is deeply devastating for the people who live there, and I do feel sorry for what their going through.",

It is a cult of personality that demands total subservience over political strategy or basic governance.
