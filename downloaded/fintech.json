    "title": "I Found The Best IPTV Service in Canada &amp; USA? My Honest Review (Sports, Movies &amp; PPV)",
    "selftext": "When I first started looking for an IPTV Service, my main goal was simple: something stable for channels from the USA and Canada. What I didn’t expect was how unreliable many IPTV Providers turned out to be after a short time. Some worked fine for a few days, then buffering and missing channels started. Because of that, I decided to properly test a few IPTV subscriptions instead of switching based on quick impressions.\n\nOne of the services I kept using during this process was **HuluxTV\\*COM** \n\nI ran it alongside other IPTV subscriptions to compare real, everyday usage rather than short trials. Over time, it stayed more consistent than most of the other IPTV Providers I tried.\n\n**Channels and Regions That Mattered to Me**\n\nContent availability was a big factor. HuluxTV covered the channels I actually watch, including IPTV USA and IPTV Canada content, plus UK and some European categories. Having these regions available in one IPTV Service made daily viewing much easier without juggling multiple subscriptions.\n\n**Performance During Normal Use ⚡**\n\nWith many IPTV subscriptions, problems usually show up during busy hours. Freezing, slow loading, or sudden drops in quality were common issues I ran into. With HuluxTV, streams loaded faster and stayed stable more often than what I experienced with other IPTV Providers, which made a noticeable difference in day-to-day use.\n\n**Devices and Setup Experience 📱💻**\n\nI tested this IPTV Service on several devices, including a TV, a streaming device, a phone, and a computer. Setup was simple, and performance stayed fairly consistent across devices. That wasn’t always the case with other IPTV Providers, where the experience changed depending on the platform.\n\n**Final Thoughts 📝**\n\nAfter spending time comparing different options, HuluxTV ended up being the IPTV Service I continued using because it held up better over time. Everyone’s needs are different, but for my usage, this IPTV subscription stayed reliable when others didn’t.\n\nIf anyone wants to share their experience with IPTV Providers or talk about what they look for in an IPTV Service, feel free to join the discussion.",

    "selftext": "I’ve always heard Stripe was the \"infrastructure powering the internet economy,\" so I dug into their story and wow.\nStripe wasn’t built with a flashy launch or VC hype. It started in 2010 when two Irish brothers, Patrick and John Collison, realized how painful it was to accept payments online. So they built a few lines of code that made it simple.\n\nWhat blew my mind:\n\nStripe started as /dev/payments, and early users included Shopify, Lyft, and Kickstarter\n\nThey raised from Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Sequoia, all in their seed round\n\nGrew quietly but rapidly, hitting a $95B valuation by 2021\n\nStayed private while generating billions in revenue and serving millions of businesses\n\nExpanded beyond payments into fraud detection, tax compliance, virtual cards, and even incorporation through Stripe Atlas\n\nTheir culture is famously intense, long-form memos &gt; meetings, and their API docs are basically gold-standard\n\nThey’ve processed hundreds of billions in volume, power companies in 46+ countries, and still haven’t gone public.\n\nI broke down the full journey, from 7 lines of code to becoming the financial layer of the internet in this [blog](https://www.plox.in/blog/stripe-story-growth-revenue)\n\nWould love to hear your take on this!",

    "selftext": "so I saw this viral post of a kid uploading a calculus problem to an AI tool and the thing solved it using his EXACT handwriting. Not similar. His actual writing style, reproduced to PERFECTION.   \n  \nI've been thinking about it for days now because of what it means for everything we've built on signature verification. Banks verify signatures, notaries rely on them, and contracts depend on them. We've structured our entire trust systems around the idea that handwriting is unique to each person. but is it anymore?   \n  \nnow a student can generate something convincing enough to pass basic human review using a free tool. The calculus homework looked completely legit to the naked eye. That's the part that's messing with me. If I didn't know it was AI-generated, I wouldn't have questioned it for a second.   \n  \nWe've already seen this pattern play out with forged photo IDs and \"perfect\" proofs of address. Handwriting is just the next tool in the box. And unlike fake IDs, this one can lead to mortgage fraud, forged authorizations, account takeovers. All of it gets easier. Most verification systems were designed for a world where imitating someone's identity took time, skill, and physical access. That world is gone. I keep wondering if the fix is better detection tech, or if we need to rethink signature-based verification entirely. Maybe biometrics? maybe something else?   \n  \nI feel like we're maybe 12 or 18 months away from this being a real operational problem but I honestly have no idea if I'm early or already late",

I left my job at a fintech company in Utah where I was one of their top salespeople. We consistently hit our targets, but the company is now refusing to pay out the commissions we’ve earned. I’m not the only one who experienced this. Two of my colleagues, both women like myself, also left due to similar issues. We quit because of a combination of misogynistic comments from the CEO, a generally toxic work environment, and the same issue of not being paid what we were owed. The CEO uses his religious beliefs to mask his toxicity against women.\n\nThe toxic environment included things like dismissive comments during meetings, sexist jokes, and excluding women from important decisions. It made the workplace really hostile and demoralizing.\n\nI’ve tried reaching out to HR, but they weren’t helpful and seemed to side with upper management. Now that I’ve left, I’m unsure of my options. I’ve documented all my sales and the commissions I’m owed, but I don’t know the best next step to actually get what I’m rightfully due. It feels like they’re banking on us just giving up and leaving without a fight.\n\nWhat are the best legal steps I can take to ensure I get paid my earned commissions? Are there any specific laws or regulations in Utah that protect workers in this kind of situation? I’m also worried about potential retaliation if I take any action. Any advice or similar experiences would be super helpful. Thanks in advance!",

    "selftext": "I was looking into how different banks handle fraud detection for a project and stumbled onto something Barclays did that I can't stop thinking about.\n\nmost fraud systems I've seen work like this: security team builds something \"robust\" and \"aggressive,\" ships it, moves on. then six months later product is scrambling because trust metrics are tanking and support tickets are through the roof.\n\nthe problem isn't that these systems fail to catch fraud. it's that they flag too many legitimate people in the crossfire. every false positive is a blocked transaction. every blocked transaction is a \"yes, that really was me\" message. every one of those is a customer doing work your system should've handled on its own.\n\nBarclays apparently flipped the whole approach. instead of optimizing for security first and smoothing friction later, they designed for customer experience from the start and built security into that foundation.\n\nthree things stood out: their ML engine thinks in milliseconds but behaves more like a human analyst. they run continuous feedback loops - model retraining, testing, error audits - so the system doesn't drift over time. And when they do block a transaction, they actually explain why. not \"suspicious activity detected\" but \"this differs from your normal spending pattern because X, Y, Z.\"\n\nthat last part is what got me. most systems just block you and make you prove yourself. Barclays tells you the reasoning. seems small but I think that's actually the difference between a customer who shrugs it off and one who starts looking for a new bank.\n\nmost fintechs treat fraud as a backend compliance function. Barclays treated it as a customer experience problem that happens to involve security.\n\ndo you think this approach actually scales or is it one of those things that only works when you have Barclays-level resources? I keep going back and forth on whether this is a genuine competitive advantage or just good PR that falls apart under pressure.",

    "selftext": "So I came across this post on LinkedIn where a guy took a real photo of himself with President Macron and used AI to swap Macron for Elizabeth Holmes. \n\nhe mentioned he used one prompt and a few clicks. Out comes a photo of him shaking hands with someone who's currently in jail and who he's never met. And it looked completely real. Like if he'd posted it without context I would've believed it. \n\nThis isn't even new anymore as i keep seeing variations of it, people faking photos with Elon Musk, Sam Altman, whoever. It's become a party trick. \"Look what I can do in two minutes.\" \n\nBut the compliance implications are what I can't stop thinking about. Current verification systems are built around \"does this look real\" as a meaningful filter. this made sense when fabrication was hard. When it took skill, time, and access to pull off a convincing fake. Now anyone can clear it in minutes with zero technical ability. \n\nThe same guy who made the Holmes photo also tested generating fake passports and utility bills. The output passes the eye test without much effort and this can be replicated in many areas (refund scams with AI-generated “damaged goods” photos, synthetic identities onboarding with generated documents, impersonations that look identical to the real person).\n\nI keep going back and forth on whether this is a solvable technical problem or if we're just watching the entire premise of visual verification collapse in slow motion. \n\nhow do you think compliance should adapt their defenses in a world where \"seeing\" is no longer \"believing\"?",

    "title": "My Advise to FinTech Founders",
    "selftext": "As an investor/entrepreneur/operator in this space, I owe it to the world to share my knowledge and experience with those coming behind me. I plan to write a book, so please feel free to take this as my foreword. If not for nothing, at least it'll save you from wasting your time, and you'll glean what not to do from my words—if you choose to absorb them.\n\nThe hardest part of starting a company in 2025 is doing so without financial support, a.k.a. capital. The degree of difficulty increases or decreases based on geographical location, race, education, associations, connections, background, etc. For a FinTech founder, this is doubly hard because you're in a space that operates solely on and with money, literal money. Your stock is money, and without it, you're screwed. This is to say, outside of business expenses, you must have money in stock for customers to utilize your service or product. Let's say you're naturally stubborn and extremely willful, like my founder. You aren't generally new in business and have supportive friends who don't mind jumping into the void with you when you have crazy ideas. You all raised some capital, let's say $100k. Let's say your brand of FinTech is in the remittance/cross-border sector. You estimate that there'll surely be a market for your product based on the market size of $800b+ alone. After all, people have been immigrating since the beginning of time, and they won't stop after you started your company.\n\nYou're off the tracks and gaining strong traction monthly. You confirm your thesis and have the proof to show monthly growth by something like 15-20%, which is generally not bad. At the end of the first year, you've processed $6m and have about $150k in revenue to show for it. You figure this is a strong positive indication of strong market sentiment. With this in mind, you decide it's time to scale, so you must raise funds because $100k can only get you so far in the space you operate. Your competitors have billions of dollars sitting in the bank; all you have to show after year 1 is your traction and a strong growth potential.\n\nYou do what everyone does when it's time to raise. In the first few months of Year 2, you seek out connections to VC, Angels, investor communities, and even join the local accelerator groups around you. You notice that most of your peers have side gigs, and their startups are the side gigs, as they all have day jobs. Of all your peers, you are the only one working full-time for your startup. You also notice that, based on the financial indicators such as cash flow, revenues, profits, etc., you are one of the very few who have numbers to back up their claim and prove product-market fit, but the people you pitch to don't seem to care much about these numbers, your market, or your potential. The people picked for funding don't even have a product, at least &gt;70% of them, but somehow they are pushed to the top of the line.\n\nAfter about three months of this activity, you decide it's a colossal waste of time and try to do it internally the way you did before. You wanted to raise at least $1m and could show what that $1m would do if injected into the business and how far it could grow, but somehow, this proved abortive. You raised another $50k from your group and kept bootstrapping, gradually growing the company. In the middle of Year 2, somewhere around $8.5 million processed and $200k in revenues, a broker contacts you out of the blue and asks you if you're still raising. Yes! You scream, of course I'm still raising you, say. They tell you to send your financials, and you do, and they tell you you have good numbers for an underfunded company, they tell you they have a \"network\" of investors to whom they can show your stuff and who might be interested in investing.\n\nYou start this journey with them after spending about $20k you don't have on things like valuations, DD, financial modeling, etc. They tell you they'll keep 10% of the million (or any amount at all) raised, and you agree to this. After all, it's not like anyone is breaking down doors to hand you a cheque. The DD alone takes about 3 months; they tell you this is standard (no one knows you, including them), and you reckon they're right. The valuations take another 3 months of back and forth between them and you. Plenty talk of valuators, different flavors, i.e., our valuators, neutral valuators, third-party valuators, known valuators, etc. At this point, you wonder if you're still a startup or somehow in an alternate reality because you can't seem to fathom why your company is even being valued to this degree. They finally land on a valuation, grossly lower than your own internal valuation conducted by your Finance team. But you're 7 months in at this point and need to close the deal.\n\n9 months in with brokers. You hear of terms like Term Sheets, Fact Sheets, etc. They tell you they are at the Term Sheet stage and that the deal will close at any moment. You wait for this moment for the next 3 months, but it never seems to come. Initially, they told you that if the raise falls through, you will get back your funds, at least around 80% of it. This was your motivation to begin, as you believed there was no risk of any losses, at least not significant. They somehow withhold the part where they work on your file and capture man-hours, which will later be reclaimed from your funds. You begin to question your reality and sanity.\n\nYou have grown your company to around $11m in processed volumes and $275k in revenue. You have demand, but your meager resources can't keep up with it, so your app processes transactions more slowly than it should. This leads to churn that only keeps rising as the number of users increases. In all of this, your founder has been on deferred comp from the beginning. Being a majority shareholder, he focused on growing the company and not drawing from it before it was worth something. You admired this because such qualities in 2025 are scarce. You want a founder who puts it all on the line, you got one.\n\nWhat is the point of this post? If you are a FinTech founder/CEO, do not start if you've not figured out or at least secured funds for a runway of 12 - 16 months minimum. If you cannot raise like my founder, then raise funds internally that compensate you as the CEO from inception and give you at least 12 - 16 months of runway. If you focus on market fit, growth, and traction in general, not paying your CEO will show a lack of structure, which has negative connotations. Finding someone willing to work without comp is admirable, but this sends the wrong signal to an investor, not to mention the inevitable and eventual burnout the CEO will experience. The only kind of investor you can succeed with is the one you find yourself, who believes in you and trusts in your vision, and more importantly, who admires your resilience. This is very rare, and even though the suffering will mature you beyond your years, is it worth it?\n\nFundraising is the hardest part of being a founder. In fact, I would argue that you should get a cofounder or partner whose job will be 24/7 fundraising activities while you focus on growing the company's value. But who will you find that's as crazy as you? The world has become too difficult, and the idea of sacrifice sounds like a myth. When you can see the obstacles in front, even beginning a venture is quite discouraging, which is why I do not recommend the path of entrepreneurship. It is a path of suffering; only conviction can allow one to tread this path willingly. Think twice before you venture in.\n\nIf you're a founder in the Ether, note that your work doesn't end after you raise money, whether internally or externally. Even when you show strong growth and potential (without being funded), you need to hit around $1M in revenue to be taken seriously by any random investor. Anything less than this, and prepare for plenty of talks and no action.\n\nChoose wisely and ensure this is what you want, or else don't start.",

    "selftext": "\nFor years, the promise of decentralization has been a core goal of the tech world. Yet, this promise has often been overshadowed by a reality where power remains concentrated in the hands of a few developers, governance becomes a social popularity contest, and software is vulnerable to human error. Today, we turn a new page by introducing a project designed to solve these fundamental challenges.\n\n**What is Tau Net? A Truly Decentralized Network**\n\nAt its core, **Tau Net is The User-Controlled Blockchain.** Unlike traditional projects, Tau Net is not manually coded by a team of developers. Instead, it is automatically generated—or **synthesized**—from the collective will and logical specifications of its participants using program synthesis. This means that the people who use the network directly determine its behavior, its rules, and its future. Users are no longer passive participants but active architects of the system.\n\n**A Paradigm Shift in Governance: Governance by Specification**\n\nTau Net's most groundbreaking innovation is its \"Governance by Specification\" model. This puts an end to endless debates, ambiguous proposals, and manual voting. On Tau Net, participants express their intentions and the rules for how the network should behave in a formal language. The system then logically analyzes these specifications, automatically identifying all points of agreement and disagreement within the community. The network synthesizes its own updates based on the agreed-upon logic, with mathematical proof of its accuracy.\n\n**Powering the New Knowledge Economy: Agoras ($AGRS)**\n\nA revolutionary network deserves a revolutionary economy. **Agoras ($AGRS)** is the native token of the Tau Net ecosystem, and it is far more than a simple currency. Agoras is designed to fuel a next-generation marketplace where high-value assets are traded, such as:\n* Formalized and verified knowledge and algorithms.\n* Smart contracts that can reason, and autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents.\n* Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (DeFAI) assets and computational resources.\n\n**Our Mission: Large-Scale Collaboration Between Humans and Machines**\n\nUltimately, the mission of Tau Net is to pioneer a new era of large-scale, automated collaboration and development between humans and machines. Our goal is to build a future where consensus is reached automatically, software is created flawlessly, and collective intelligence can be harnessed to solve problems on a global scale.\n\nThis is more than an introduction; it's an invitation to join us on a journey to redefine the future of the internet and collaboration.\n\n**To discover more and join our community:**\n* **Official Website:** https://tau .net\n* **Twitter:** https://twitter.com/tau_net\n* **Telegram:** @ taunet/1\n* **Discord:** https://discord .com/invite/nsCZ4f3wqH",

    "title": "In fintech, wrong words can cost you - Here's what I mean by that and what to avoid",
    "selftext": "There’s a quiet kind of struggle most people don’t see when you're building a fintech product from scratch. You’re juggling regulations, growth metrics, product deadlines, and a thousand other invisible fires.\n\nSo it’s understandable that some things slip through the cracks. But there’s one crack that turns into a legal sinkhole if you’re not careful: **How you describe yourself in public.**\n\n**The risk hiding in your website copy**\n\nNot long ago, I was reviewing a contract for a promising fintech startup. They had just signed a few B2B clients. The surface looked great:\n\n* Sharp pitch deck\n* Beautiful UI\n* Clear positioning\n\nBut then I landed on their About page: **“We’re a digital bank.”**\n\nExcept… they weren’t. No banking license. No RBI registration. No NBFC approval. No regulatory coverage at all.\n\nJust a clean branding phrase from someone’s copy sprint. And that’s the kind of thing that feels harmless—until a regulator sees it.\n\n**In Fintech, words carry legal weight**\n\nYou can’t casually call yourself a:\n\n* Bank\n* Investment advisor\n* Credit provider\n* Insurance platform\n* Regulated entity\n\nUnless you are legally licensed to be one.\n\nUnless you are actually licensed to be one. In highly regulated markets like India, the UK, or the US, these words don’t just describe you - they define you in the eyes of the law.\n\n**Common mistakes I see**\n\nLet’s break this down with examples.\n\n**1. Website copy that overreaches**\n\nYou say:\n\n“Experience borderless digital banking.”\n\nWhat the regulator reads:\n\n“You’re offering banking services without a license.”\n\nA safer alternative:\n\n“Banking-like experience through licensed partners.”\n\nor “A digital platform to manage payments and cards.”\n\n**2. Pitch decks that use restricted language**\n\nA founder writes:\n\n“Licensed payment processor with global reach.”\n\nBut are *you* licensed—or your backend partners? That distinction matters. If the wrong investor or regulator misunderstands that claim, it can trigger serious consequences.\n\n**3. Contracts that overpromise**\n\nI’ve seen this in actual agreements:\n\n“The Company will process customer payments and settle them to user accounts.”\n\nBut the company wasn’t a licensed PSP or Payment Aggregator. This line needed to say:\n\n“The Company facilitates payments through licensed partners and does not hold or settle funds directly.”\n\nPrecision matters.\n\n**It’s not JUST legal risk - It’s reputation Too**\n\nIt’s not just regulators reading your site or decks.\n\nIt’s also:\n\n* Investors during diligence\n* Bank partners assessing risk\n* Clients checking legitimacy\n* Journalists sniffing around\n\nAnd once that trust is shaken, even unintentionally, it’s hard to earn back. I’ve seen deals fall apart over one line of unclear language.\n\n**So what should you do?**\n\nHere’s what I recommend to every fintech founder I work with:\n\n**1. Be precise about Your Role**\n\nDon’t exaggerate. If you *facilitate* payments, say that. If you *partner* with lenders, clarify that you don’t disburse funds directly.\n\n**2. Avoid regulated terms unless you’re licensed**\n\nWords like:\n\n* Bank\n* Lending platform\n* Insurance provider\n* Investment advisor\n\n...are legally loaded. Only use them if you hold the actual license. Safer alternatives include:\n\n* “Digital finance platform”\n* “Partner-powered lending journeys”\n* “Prepaid card solutions via regulated issuers”\n\n**3. Use disclaimers everywhere**\n\nMost early-stage fintechs forget this. A simple disclaimer like:\n\n“We are a software platform and do not provide banking, investment, or advisory services. All financial services are delivered by licensed partners.”\n\n...can save you from expensive confusion down the road.\n\n**4. Audit more than just your contracts**\n\nDon’t stop at your Terms of Service. Audit everything public-facing:\n\n* Website copy\n* Pitch decks\n* Onboarding flows\n* Social media bios\n* WhatsApp or Slack sales messages\n\nIf a regulator can see it, they can scrutinize it.\n\n**TL;DR - In fintech, loose words can cause Legal harm**\n\n* Words like *bank*, *investment*, and *licensed* have specific legal meanings\n* If you don’t hold the license, don’t imply that you do\n* Use disclaimers\n* Avoid restricted terms\n* Audit your copy before a regulator does\n\n**Final thought: Read like a regulator**\n\nHere’s a quick test you can run today: Open your homepage. Pretend you’re from the **RBI**, **FCA**, or **SEC**.\n\nNow ask: **“Does this language suggest we’re doing more than we’re legally allowed to?”**\n\nIf the answer is yes - even slightly - fix it. Because in fintech, it’s not just about tech, traction, or timelines.\n\nIt’s also about accountability. And sometimes, **a single word** can be the difference between growth and a government notice.",

    "selftext": "For years, every IPTV service I tried followed the same pattern: great for the first week, then constant buffering during live matches, channels disappearing, or the service going offline entirely. After wasting a lot of money, I genuinely thought a reliable IPTV service no longer existed.\n\nThat changed this year when I started using Smartiflix and Trimixtriangles. After months of testing, these are the only two IPTV services that have stayed consistently stable and actually deliver what people expect from the \\*best IPTV service\\*.\n\n---\n\n## Smooth Streaming – What a Best IPTV Service Should Deliver\n\nThe biggest issue with most IPTV providers is performance under pressure. With both Smartiflix and Trimixtriangles, streams stay stable even during peak hours.\n\n\\* Premier League &amp; Champions League\n\\* NFL, NBA, NHL\n\\* UFC &amp; PPV events\n\\* Movies and series in HD &amp; 4K\n\nChannels load fast, stay connected, and don’t freeze when traffic spikes. That alone separates these two from 90% of IPTV services out there.\n\n---\n\n## Content Library – Live TV + VOD Done Right\n\nA true best IPTV service isn’t just about live channels.\n\n### Smartiflix\n\n\\* Strong focus on live TV and sports\n\\* Well-organized USA, UK, and Canada channel sections\n\\* Excellent EPG accuracy for live programming\n\n### Trimixtriangles\n\n\\* Massive VOD library with movies and TV series\n\\* Frequent updates\n\\* High-bitrate HD and 4K content (not fake upscaled streams)\n\\* Catch-up TV available on many major channels\n\nTogether, they cover everything: sports, entertainment, news, and on-demand content.\n\n---\n\n## Best IPTV Service for All Devices\n\nBoth services work smoothly across all major platforms:\n\n\\* Firestick &amp; Fire TV\n\\* Android TV &amp; Android phones\n\\* Smart TVs\n\\* iOS devices\n\nThey’re fully compatible with popular apps like TiviMate, IBO Player Pro, IPTV Smarters, and XCIPTV. Setup takes only a few minutes using Xtream Codes or M3U.\n\n---\n\n## Affordable IPTV With Premium Performance\n\nDespite performing like high-end IPTV services, both Smartiflix and Trimixtriangles offer reasonable pricing with monthly and longer-term plans. Considering the stability and content quality, they easily compete with what people call the \\*best IPTV services\\* in the USA and Canada.\n\n---\n\n## Reliable Support (Rare in IPTV)\n\nSupport is another area where these stand out.\n\n\\* Fast response times\n\\* Helpful setup and EPG assistance\n\\* Clear communication\n\nThat level of support is uncommon in the IPTV space and makes a big difference long term.\n\n---\n\n## Why Smartiflix &amp; Trimixtriangles Stand Out in 2025\n\n\\* No buffering during peak hours\n\\* Reliable live sports streaming\n\\* USA, CA, UK channels included\n\\* Works on all major devices\n\\* Stable VOD with no freezing\n\\* Consistent uptime\n\nSmartiflix is ideal if you mainly care about live TV and sports stability.\nTrimixtriangles is perfect if you want movies, series, and high-quality VOD.\n\n---\n\n## Final Verdict – Best IPTV Services Right Now\n\nAfter testing multiple providers this year, Smartiflix and Trimixtriangles are the only IPTV services that have consistently delivered without the usual issues.\n\nNot sponsored. Not affiliated. Just sharing real experience after years of unreliable IPTV services.\n\nIf you’re searching for the best IPTV, a stable IPTV service, or a dependable option for the USA, Canada, or UK, these two are absolutely worth considering.",
