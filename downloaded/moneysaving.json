If you’ve found any realistic ways to save or make even a little extra, I’d really appreciate hearing what’s actually worked. I’ve seen people mention flipping free/cheap items locally, doing small survey tasks on sites like KashKick, or even trying simple UGC-style gigs on Methods app where you follow a script and upload a short video, but do those actually pay real money, or are they just overhyped?

A friend mentioned grabbing numbers online so I tried [https://freezvon.com/](https://fr⁤eezv⁤on.c⁤om/) and got a couple of temp numbers for returns, kinda convenient, nothing fancy, SMS sometimes shows up a bit late but workable. Before that I tried using WhatsApp Business on my main SIM but clients kept calling at 11pm which drove me nuts. Thought about Twilio too, but it felt like coding homework, so I dropped it. I’m just trying to keep things simple and not pay for stuff I barely use. Anyone here found a low-effort way to handle this without getting buried in apps?",

Nothing fancy — just habits that stuck:  \n  \n  \n  \n• I always check if there are any codes floating around before checkout. Sometimes they only take off a couple dollars, sometimes more, but it adds up over time.  \n  \n• I compare the same item across a few different listings or platforms. Prices can vary more than you’d think.  \n  \n• If I’m not in a rush, I leave things in my cart for a day or two — a lot of sites push small discounts or reminders when they notice.  \n  \n• I avoid buying single low-cost items with shipping; bundling things usually makes it cheaper overall.  \n  \n• And if I’m on AliExpress specifically (US), the checkout codes sometimes stack with ongoing deals, so I test them just in case.  \n\n（$2 off $10 → CHIP2 ，$5 off $25 → CHIP5 ，$7 off $35 → CHIP7 ，$10 off $50 →CHIP10 ，$14 off $70 → CHIP14， $20 off $100 →CHIP20 ，$25 off $125 → CHIP25）  \n  \n  \nNothing groundbreaking, but these tiny things have saved me a bit here and there.",

    "selftext": "Hello all, Im looking into the best way to put money aside for another family member of mine. \nId rather not go into the full detail, but I'll just put it as life can be sour at times and I just want to make life a little easier for my family member if life/relationships goes in unexpected ways. \n\nTo put it plain and simple im looking for someway I can direct deposit say $20-25 from every weekly check aside into some form of savings that will gain interest on itself while in said account. \n\nBut at the very same time I need to be able to reach that account incase this individual ever comes to me and says that life is no longer satisfying them any longer and that they will likely be leaving. I want to give them cold hard cash to make said transition a little easier on themselves.\n\nI have heard a few people in life talk about HYSA, but I have very little knowledge on it all as for all my life my only banking experience has been with a local credit union, with extremely low interest rates. But alas; i dont know much about banking and what my best route would be. Are HYSA guaranteed as in i cant lose out on anything i deposit? do i have to make withdrawal transactions to keep it open, or is just simply depositing weekly enough?\n\nId like to set this fund/savings up quite soon so any advice would be appreciated!\nIf no one responds to this I'll likely just open a separate savings with my credit union with no form of card tied to the account (I.E. a debit card or savings card) so I physically have to make a withdrawal at my credit union. \n\nTIA,\nAn adult who loves his family deeply\n\n",
