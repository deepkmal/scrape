    "selftext": "A random Reddit DM led to my first client, a $5,000 setup fee, and $500 in MRR. The product? A simple system that solves a painfully boring problem for a brick-and-mortar business. Here’s the story.\n\nIt started with a message from a guy who runs a mall. We were just talking about tech, but he mentioned a major headache: hiring people just to manually count inventory and track foot traffic. It was expensive, slow, and prone to error.\n\nThis sounded like a problem I could actually solve.\n\nSo, I built a system that plugs into their existing CCTV cameras. It uses the video feed to generate reports on how many people visited, where they spent their time, and what items sold. No fancy hardware needed.\n\nAfter two months, the results were better than I expected. Customer experience improved, sales increased, and he was able to reassign his inventory staff to more productive tasks. He happily paid $5,000 for the setup and is now paying $500/month for maintenance.\n\nThis got me digging, and the scale of the problem is staggering. Inventory distortion (overstocks, out-of-stocks) costs businesses **$1.7 trillion globally** each year. For a single company, it can wipe out 10-30% of annual profits.\n\nSo, I’m turning the system into a simple, plug-and-play tool for other businesses. It provides an end-of-day report and even flags anomalies that might need a manual review acting like a helpful assistant for existing staff, not a replacement.\n\nMy question for this community is about the next step. I’ve proven the value with one client, but now I’m thinking about how to scale. For those of you who have turned a one-off solution into a scalable product, what was your biggest challenge?",

Finding fresh ideas consistently.**\n\nThree things that break most founder marketing:\n\n**Volume beats perfection.** You need 100 decent posts, not 3 perfect ones. Most founders can't sustain this.\n\n**Authenticity vs metrics.** Everyone preaches authentic voice until they get a taste of viral reach. Then they chase numbers and lose their edge.\n\n**Content is 50%.** The other 50% is DMs, comments, relationship building. Most founders want to post and ghost. Doesn't work.\n\n**The surprise:** Even building \"simple\" LinkedIn AI tools hit constant walls. No real API access. Everything needs workarounds.\n\n**Bottom line:** Founder-led marketing works because authenticity scales better than ads. But you have to treat it like product development - systematic and persistent.\n\nMost established founders I know either nail this or completely ignore social. Very little middle ground.\n\nWhat's your take - worth the time investment or better to focus purely on product/sales?",

    "title": "What I learned after stumbling into being a fractional CTO and working with non-technical founders.",
    "selftext": "TL;DR:\n\n* Non-technical founders: Be open to giving up some control and more than equity.\n* Those supporting non-technical founders: Focus more on complementary skills and connections outside of just technical know-how.\n* To both: it's ok to be uncertain about direction and goals; but not unclear about either.\n\n\\---\n\nI've been what is now considered a fraction CTO for nearly a decade. It's been something I did on the side mostly, which now is rather trendy. I started to dive deeper and reflect a bit on things.\n\nUsually, I help founders after three events: (1) they get funding and are scared to engage with a dev firm without knowing how to keep them honest. (2) They hired a dev firm and need help with damage control and getting things back on track. (3) They want to show an investor they have someone onboard to help build out a product team for their product or service.\n\nI've been hoarding some insights, and I figure it's time to share. My goal is to help both the non-technical founder seeking support and the technical fractional giving support.\n\n## What usually didn't go well\n\n* Gaining momentum after damage control — This rarely goes as well as I would like. Usually, they've spent 10's of thousands or a couple million on a product they can't sell. It often puts me in a situation where we need to work magic on a shoestring budget, an impossible timeline with a mountain of tech debt, and mentally tapped engineers. While trying to sell a broken product that nobody asked for. In short, we would have two months to sell a product with little to no budget for someone who doesn't need it... but curious and is pals with the founder.\n* Giving up control — The operational founders (compared to sales or marketing founders) have the most challenging time giving up control. These people are process-oriented and struggle to accept not being the tip of the spear.\n* Post-exit founders — These are folks trying to re-capture lighting in a bottle and can't leverage the past team they performed well with. This is where \"what got you here won't get you there\". They had a decent first-time exit and wanted to step it up for the next company. Then, realize they're not as equipped (usually a combo of the first two). In these cases, our engagement quickly turns ego-stroking (\"in my last company...\") and emotional therapy about not measuring up to the last win.\n\n## What went well (surprisingly)\n\n* Founders who would rather be account execs than CEOs — Supporting founders with a drive to close and zero ambition to run the company has been great. This almost always introduces first-world problems. They get out of the way fast and trust even faster. They usually hire an awesome exec assistant (not to be confused with \"virtual assistant\"...) who plays the operations role or a true COO who eventually brings on an assistant. In every case, we suffered from not releasing features quickly enough to keep up with a growing waitlist. IMO, it is a great problem to have. They would organize pre-sales while I nurture them with user testing and validation.\n* Founders who wanted an internal culture — In these cases, I would stand up an agile team and avoid external vendors this time around. Usually, nearshore hires and green hires in the states with a focus on keeping everyone in the same timezone. This was hands down the most work as you're building a bespoke team and dealing with churn (which having a vendor mitigates), but it was the most rewarding. There's something to be said about finding a rockstar engineer/designer who never had a shot. I would give it to them and eventually position them as the lead architect of the product. Set them up to handle sales engineering and be the founder's right hand. This allowed sunset my role to *just* advisory/mentorship.\n* Supporting corporate escapees — Imagine VPs and Directors at matrix-driven organizations who got burned out and wanted to pivot their careers. These are the people I relate to as I also \"escaped\". This went well mainly because we spoke the same language and came from similar company cultures despite the difference in hard skills. We built rapport quickly, many from sharing war stories. There's something to be said about leveraging your past life to build chemistry.\n\n## Some takeaways\n\n* For those seeking fractional support — Learn to toss in the towel and give up some control to gain freedom. Make it enticing for someone who is your opposite to join the journey. Equity doesn't mean much nowadays (and, in many cases, just insulting). However, dragging a relatively introverted technical lead to events and conferences and forcing them to network is more impactful as it usually won't happen otherwise (🤷🏽‍♂️). Fostering unique connections is more valuable than equity in a startup with a 10% chance of winning (90% don't succeed).\n* For those who provide technical support — Find people and products who complement you. Don't chase cash. Instead, think more like a rational investor who invests in people knowing a successful product is a by-product given they have proper support (you). Partner with people who can open more doors than you can imagine. Just be sure and ready to have (and keep) a working product for them to shove through those doors.\n* To both — Get a second opinion from people you trust before hiring a critical vendor (ie: a development firm). I never seen people burn so much cash from being misinformed in my life. Especially when going zero-to-one. It's a specific type of team and process for this company stage that knows how to deal well with uncertainty and ambiguity while knowing how to implement under pressure. It's a different vendor type compared to \"maintenance dev teams\" who keep the lights on and usually are more alluring for the less experienced founder... due to being cheaper and often taking credit for already launched products where the bulk of the challenges have been addressed by the zero-to-one team (huge annoyance, but I'll digress).\n* Lastly — It's ok to be uncertain but not unclear, and for the love of god... not both. In every situation where I jumped on a sinking ship hoping to save it, the founder operated strictly off their gut, and communication was very \"emotional.\" Historically, it is a recipe for disaster, but it is also where I had my biggest (and most expensive) learning lessons.\n\nI hope this helps someone, somewhere, doing something similar.",

    "selftext": "Starting my own clothing brand was a real plunge into the unknown. Ever start something big and think, \"Well, this is harder than I thought\"? That was me, every day for the first year. I began with more enthusiasm than strategy, armed with a belief that ‘passion conquers all’. (Spoiler: It doesn’t. You need a plan.) Here's what I've learned from building my business from the ground up:\n\n* One thing about business—**it’s never static.** Early on, I launched a product line that flopped so hard it could’ve made the ‘Top 10 Entrepreneurial Fails’ list. It taught me to pivot fast and listen even faster. ***Adapting isn’t just about new ideas; it’s about shedding old ones that don’t work.***\n* Customer Engagement. Listening to my customers. I mean really listening, not just nodding along while mentally rehearsing my next pitch. Feedback is gold, even when it’s tougher to swallow than overcooked steak.\n* Designs. Oh boy, did I have ideas! Initially, I thought every design I dreamt up was a hit—until reality checked in. I soon realized the power of audience interaction; **I started conducting polls, gathering feedback directly on social media**, and iterating designs based on what people actually wanted. \n* Developing a community around your brand can provide invaluable feedback and foster strong customer loyalty. A loyal community not only supports sales but can also **act as brand ambassadors, spreading word-of-mouth endorsements.**\n* Quality cuts through the noise. I learned to focus less on how often we launched and more on what we launched. **Quality over quantity** meant transforming our products from **‘nice-to-haves’ to ‘must-haves’.**\n* **People connect with stories, not sales pitches**. I learned to weave our values and visions into our brand narrative. ***When people see why you care, they care about what you see.***\n* My go-to resources: shoutout to **Canva** for making my design ideas look professional (and saving me from my disastrous Photoshop attempts), **Boost App Socia**l for being a lifesaver for our social media efforts, and a solid CRM for helping us manage customer relationships effectively. I've also relied heavily on **Mailchimp** for keeping our audience engaged through email marketing.\n\nEvery day, the dream gets clearer, and the path gets a little less intimidating. Remembering ‘why’ you started is your anchor. Keep pushing, keep innovating, and, most importantly, keep enjoying the ride. What’s in your survival kit? Let’s learn from each other because, frankly, the entrepreneurial path is too wild to walk alone.",

But I’ve noticed a really toxic belief that keeps creeping in: “If I’m not suffering, I’m not going to succeed.”  \nLike unless I’m miserable and overworked, it doesn’t feel like I’m making real progress. And it’s killing my motivation. It’s like I associate success with pain now - and if I’m not hating life, I worry I’m not doing enough.\n\nI’ve heard others say you need to be “naively optimistic” to start a company - to not think too much about the suffering ahead or you’ll never begin. But I can't help overthinking it. And if the price of success is more years of being isolated and miserable… I’m honestly questioning the point of it all.\n\nHas anyone else felt this way? How do you unlearn the idea that success must come from pain? Would love to hear your experiences.",

As someone running a business, I’m more interested in the AI tools that actually help with real work, saving time, cutting costs, or helping things run smoother.\n\nI asked a group of 100+ VC-backed founders in a Slack group I’m part of what AI agents they’re actually paying for that are helping their business. The answers were super useful, so I wanted to share them here in case they help you too and also to see what tools you might be using that I haven’t heard of yet.\n\nFor sales, a few people mentioned tools like Regie.ai, Instantly.ai, and Smartlead. These help with cold emailing, LinkedIn outreach, and follow-ups without needing to hire a big sales team.\n\nFor marketing, founders said they’re using ZimmWriter, Surfer AI, and Frase.io. These tools help write blog posts, find the right keywords, and boost SEO, basically making it easier to get traffic from Google.\n\nWhen it comes to design and content, some folks are using Kittl and Designs.ai for graphics and branding stuff, and Runway ML or Pika Labs to make videos with AI. Pretty useful if you don’t have a design or video team.\n\nOn the tech/dev side, tools like Codeium and Cody by Sourcegraph are helping engineers write code faster. And for non-coders, Popsy and Softr make it easy to build apps or websites without needing to code at all. If you want to go even faster, V0 by Vercel can turn plain English into working UI prototypes.\n\nAnd for customer support, a bunch of people have started using Customerly. It helps answer common questions from customers using AI, so your team doesn’t have to spend hours replying to the same stuff every day.\n\nThat’s just a sample of what other founders are using right now. I’m still testing a few of these myself, but I’d love to hear from you too. What AI tools are you using to actually run your business better? Doesn’t have to be fancy just something that saves you time, money, or headaches. Let’s share ideas.\n\n",

Brands doing less than 30k a month often don't need all of these emails, they can focus on abandoned cart, welcome series and browse abonnement. Brands doing more than 150k a month will need more in-depth flow work but I can expand on that in another post.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Welcome Series** **(6-10 emails)**\n\n\n\n1. Thanks for signing up\n2. Discount reminder\n3. Welcome to the family (buyers)\n4. Join our rewards point program (If applicable) (buyers)\n5. Learn about the brand (non-buyers)\n6. Social proof + Follow us on social (non-buyers)\n7. Last Chance to use gift (non-buyers)\n8. Discount reminder (non-buyers)\n\n**Post Purchase (Broken into multiple flows)**\n\n\n\n1. Thanks &amp; welcome to the brand (1x)\n2. Gift as a token of appreciation(1x)\n3. Gift Reminder(1x)\n4. Congratulate them on their decision to buy again + show appreciation (2x)\n5. Gift Reminder (if applicable) (2x)\n6. Review Request (2x)\n7. VIP STATUS Achieved (3x)\n8. Gift Reminder (if applicable) (3x)\n9. Referral/Points/Ambassador Program (if applicable) (3x)\n\n**Browse Abandonment (3-5 Emails)**\n\n\n\n1. Saw something you liked?\n2. Still interested?\n3. Social Proof + Possible Discount\n4. Discount Reminder (If applicable)\n\n**Abandoned Cart (5-8 emails) (custom abandon cart flows for specific products if necessary)**\n\n\n\n1. Looks like you left this behind\n2. Still interested?\n3. Stock running low\n4. Social proof\n5. Educational emails about why customers should buy from you (If applicable)\n6. Discount\n7. Reminder\n\n**Sunset Flow (2-3 Emails)**\n\n\n\n1. Ask unengaged subscribers if they are still interested\n2. Final opt out opportunity\n\n**Customer Winback (3-5 emails)**\n\n\n\n1. Check out what’s new\n2. Showcase positive recent customer buying experience\n3. Discount\n4. Reminder\n\n**Customer Review**\n\n\n\n1. Offer discount for review\n2. Discount delivery + customer appreciation\n\n**Special Flows**\n\n\n\n1. Cross Sell (Used when you have a common upsell with one of your hot products)\n2. Affiliate Program flow (used if you have ambassador or affiliate programs setup)\n3. Rewards point flow (breaks down and encourages reward points systems such as smile io)\n4. Replenishment reminder (for stores with consumable products)\n\nThis is relatively simple work, but it is time-consuming and will probably take at least a few days to complete. But no need to worry, you don't have to go all out. Simply turning on some of the Klaviyo default flows and editing them so that they're onbrand will easily boost your revenue by at least 5%. Dont be discouraged to dedicate a couple days into your back-end automated marketing. These sales add up, the earlier you set these emails up, the more money you'll make in the long run.",
