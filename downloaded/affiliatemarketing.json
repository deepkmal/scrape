    "selftext": "Hey Reddit, so I ran this affiliate thing for legal leads and pulled in $293,890 over six months. Took some testing, but it worked out.\n\nHere’s how it went down.I used paid Facebook ads—Facebook, Instagram, all their placements about $132k total.\n\nThat got me 2,532 leads at $150 each and 255 calls worth $31,340.\n\nRevenue hit $293k, though some leads went unpaid if they’d been submitted by another publisher in the last 30-60 days.\n\nSold everything to an aggregator, not direct to lawyers.\n\nThe big shift was going Spanish instead of English.\n\nEnglish market’s crowded—everyone’s doing it. Spanish had less competition, cheaper ads, better conversion rates. Cost per lead dropped from $70 to around $50, and the leads were solid, closing more deals.\n\nMade a real difference.\n\nWhat worked? Manual bidding and AI UGC ads\n\nManual bidding kept my costs steady—no surprises. AI for user-generated content cut ad production costs from $150 a pop to $15, and production went from days to maybe an hour with edits.\n\nLead quality and CPL stayed the same as human-made ads. I’ve been playing with AI for like 10 years, so it was an easy call.\n\nSetup was simple: targeted Spanish speakers on Facebook, ran Spanish UGC ads, built a Spanish landing page.\n\nConversion rates went up, costs went down. If I had one tip, it’d be this: look at less competitive markets. Switching languages can flip your costs if you’re smart about it. Test manual bids too—saves you cash.\n\nThat’s it. Questions, let me know. (edited for clarity on ad spend)",

Here's a list of my screwups, hope it helps someone.\n\n* I was obsessed with keywords and my posts sounded like a damn robot. I was writing for google, not for an actual person. No personlity at all, just dry info.\n* My traffic stratgy was literally just 'post and pray'. I thought SEO was some kind of magic and didnt bother trying to promote my articles anywhere else. No pinterest, no forums, nothing.\n* I promoted products I'd never actually touched. I was basically just rewriting amazon reviews and trying to pass it off as a real opinion. People can smell that fakeness from a mile away.\n* I got impatient and quit way too early. This is the one that really gets me. Looking back at the analytics, the traffic was *just* starting to slowly tick up. I was probably a few months away from things actually working, but I got discouraged cause I wasnt rich yet.\n\nAnyway, my new site is doing a lot better cause im avoiding all that. Its slow, but its real progress.\n\nHope this helps someone else not make the same dumb mistakes I did.\n\n**TL;DR:** My first site failed cause I wrote like a robot, had no traffic plan besides praying to google, promoted stuff I never used, and quit right before it probably would have worked.

    "selftext": "Hello, everyone. A couple of days ago, I made this post, and it seemed to help and inspire a lot of people, and I got a ton of DMs, questions, which is good. I enjoy helping people and I got to as many questions as i could.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/1h79yh9/made\\_25k\\_with\\_youtube\\_and\\_affiliate\\_marketing/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\\_term=1&amp;utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/1h79yh9/made_25k_with_youtube_and_affiliate_marketing/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\nOne of the most common questions my DMs were about is how to choose a niche on YouTube since everything seems to be crowded.\n\nSo I wanted to share how I personally picked my niche, and make it simple and straight to the point, so those who are just getting started and need clarity can benefit.\n\nI've been doing YouTube over the last 4 years, but I started taking it seriously (being intentional) over the last year and a half.\n\nWhen I was re-calibrating my YouTube strategy, I started doing more research on what viewers wanted.\n\nI ran into a video of a product in the personal finance niche, which I had used myself and had good experience.\n\nWhen I watched the video, I noticed a couple of things:\n\n1. The channel had about 20K subscribers\n2. The video about the product review had about 50K views\n\nNow, after a lot of lessons learned on YouTube, and also after taking a whole YouTube course, I learned that if a video has a lot more views than a channel has subscribers over the last year, it means there is a lot of demand for such video.\n\nFor example, if a video has 100K views, and the channel has 10K subscribers, AND it was posted over the last couple of months, the probability of success are VERY high.\n\nI can almost guarantee it.\n\nThat's been my experience with many of the videos I made (In fact, this is a strategy that helped me monetize a \"viral\" entertainment channel in only two weeks (got 10. This is a side project. It's a faceless channel.).\n\nAnyway, I decided to make the same video, reviewing the same product, with my own spin.\n\nI was genuine about it, sharing what I thought, and the video had the following structure:\n\n1. My quick story using the product (1 minute to 2 minutes max)\n2. Then I went over the current best features\n3. Then over the pros, cons  of the product\n4. Overall recommendation (who's it for?)\n5. Call to action letting people know I had a link in the description they could use to sign up.\n\nThat was it.\n\nNot surprisingly, that video did very well, and I maxed out all of my affiliates eventually (for those who don't know, many products in the personal finance niche have a ceiling and you have a limit on how much you can earn. They do this so they prevent people from engaging in \"illicit  activities.\" That's what I found.)\n\nAnyway, my experience right here gave me the idea to go down even deeper into this product and its industry.\n\nI started making more reviews about it, answering frequently asked questions in the videos, and comparing it to other competitors.\n\nI signed up for more of the competitors for research purposes, and I started expanding the affiliates I got.\n\nI didn't always get approved, and some of the products I signed up for did not have affiliates, but I had enough to start making decent money.\n\nMy best day, I made about 500 USD in one day.\n\nI won't lie, there are some videos I made that flopped, that didn't get many views, but others that did.\n\nIf there is one thing I learned from Jeff Bezos is this:\n\nIn business, you will have many failures. But then you will have one or two products that succeed, and they will make up and pay for all the failures and even more.\n\nI try to keep this in mind when I am making YouTube videos.\n\nI'm sure you've noticed this as well in some capacity. If you go to any YouTube channel, you'll see not every video has the same performance. There will always be outliers. Even for Mr. Beast.\n\nAnyway, how can you choose your niche? Why am I sharing all of this?\n\nHere's a few pointers for you:\n\n1. Learn into your experience (even if it's a \"saturated\" niche): What's a product you used, that you have experience with? Even if it's investing, just talk about it. Once you talk about that one product, you can expand and talk about its competitors. This is what I did. I used X product, then I compared it to Y. Then I reviewed Y product by itself. It's just a matter of arranging your cards to win.\n2. Expand and experiment: If you've had experience with multiple products, talk about them all. Do keyword research to see what people are watching, what is trending.\n3. Don't be afraid to sign up for programs, buy the product if it's physical. You can always buy it, review it, and then return it. Look into what other people are saying online, and then add that to your video with screenshots.\n4. Keep it simple: If you are doing beyond your comfort zone, going to talk about a product that you have no clue about only because it may make money, I guarantee you will burn out. This is what I experienced too. I was talking so much about one product that I got sick of it. haha, so don't be afraid to expand and explore other similar/parallel products. It's good to start specific, then slowly vary the content and reviews.\n\nOnce you choose your niche, here are a few other pointers to successfully do affiliate marketing on YouTube:\n\na) Quality matters: If affiliate marketing is your main thing on YouTube, focus on providing the most value to your customers. That is, doing research, answering questions people have in comments in forums, essentially sharing insight that your viewers can't just find by going to the website of the product. I personally like to share \"FAQs\" with every video. Not only does it increase YouTube watch time (which means more ad money and good for the channel), it also adds more credibility and trust (more money).\n\nb) Camera presence on YouTube is huge: In 2024, if you are talking to a professional audience, if you are educating, or sharing a review of a product, you need a good background, a good mic, and good camera presence. You don't have to be the world's best speaker, but you do have to be professional. This doesn't mean be fake, this just means being yourself, but still professional.\n\nc) Some tools I use to make my YouTube videos:\n\ni. I use my phone to record, on a tripod.\n\nii. Green screen (30 USD). If you don't have a \"nice\" background, you can get a green screen and then just slap a nice background on it. A lot of big YouTubers do this. Better than a  white wall. Viewers judge the background more than you think. It's OK to start modest, but eventually, gotta improve.\n\niii. Mic. I use the Yetti, record it, then use adobe podcast to improve the audio. It makes my 100 USD mic sound like the SHURE, which costs like 300 USD. Be resourceful and work with what you have\n\niv. Canva for thumbnails (free version)\n\nv. Perplexity for research (free version) and ChatGpt for script writing sometimes (paid version).\n\nThat's pretty much all for now.\n\nHope it helps.",

Sometimes 1, sometimes none.\n\nThe pay out for every 1,000 views in the finance niche can vary; it can be as low as 2-4 dollars for \"broad\" videos like \"how to get out of debt\" and it can go as high as over 100 USD for super targeted videos. Of course, it's never constant. It always varies (which is the down side of relying on ad sense).\n\nThe split has been around 50/50 between affiliates and ad sense.\n\nMy videos don't go viral, they get about 10-20K views over time.\n\nOne video made over $1100 just on Ad revenue (with about 20K views).\n\nWhen it comes to affiliates, you really have to hunt them. Impact is a good source for many products and services you can promote, you just have to make sure they align with the channel, so you can build credibility and trust, and make them valuable to people, so users are encouraged to use your links.\n\nOne key lesson I've learned is the more helpful and valuable your video is, the more likely viewers will be to use your links.\n\nLet know what questions you have with respect to affiliates, YouTube, etc.\n\nOpen to questions.\n\n  \n(PS: I figured I shared this here in this community as well)",

    "selftext": " I'm an adult content affiliate, out of all the niches I've tried this one has by far been the easiest and quickest to scale. Now my tips will apply to anyone who's in affiliate marketing no matter what niche. \n\nTip 1 - Choose a good &amp; trusted affiliate company to promote. There's many out there, take your time and research each companies reviews before choosing one to join. \n\nTip 2 - Promote the offers you have correctly. By far, I make my most money off Revshare offers. This is my bread and butter because I collect a percentage of everything my traffic spends for life. Whether they purchase a product, buy a membership, or purchase tokens to tip the cam models they enjoy watching. Ill collect a percentage of that for life. \n\nHowever if you're just starting out and don't have social pages that push in a lot of traffic then you should look to start out promoting PPL (pay per lead) affiliate offers. These offers payout smaller amounts however it's much easier to earn from because your traffic doesn't have to spend a penny. \n\nThere's two types of PPL offers which are SOI &amp; DOI. \nSingle Opt In &amp; Double Opt In. SOI payouts are a little smaller than DOI but they're easier to get. Whenever your traffic clicks your offer and creates an account on the platform you're promoting all they have to do is confirm their email OR phone number for you to get paid. Simple and easy to get. For DOI offers your traffic would need to confirm their email + their phone number in order for you to get paid. \n\nOvertime as you build your traffic sources you'll want to start implementing revshare lifetime offers so that you can start building your passive income portfolio. \n\nTip 3 - This is the most important one that surprisingly a lot of people struggle with. If you want to be successful then you HAVE to be consistent with posting to your social accounts so that your traffic sources are continuously building. \n\nIf you can follow that strategy and of course implement your own then I promise you'll make a living in affiliate marketing no matter what niche you're in 🤙 If you read this far and find this knowledge useful consider letting me know. I'm happy to help others, and while I'm not a professional insanely rich influencer, I have found my niche and I'm making more money online then any 9-5 job I've ever worked. So hopefully my experience can help someone else! ",

    "selftext": "Ive been doing affiliate marketing for about 18 months mostly through SEO and its been slow going, couple hundred bucks a month max. I decided to test pinterest hard starting in july because I needed to diversify traffic sources\n\n**Niche:** Home &amp; kitchen products (amazon associates mainly)\n\n**Strategy:** I created a pinterest business account and started posting product roundup pins (best coffee makers, best kitchen gadgets under $50 etc) Im using tailwind to schedule 12 pins per day consistently because manual posting was impossible to maintain. I joined 12 communities in the home/kitchen niche through tailwind which amplified reach significantly.\n\n**Results timeline:** month 1: $143 in commissions (almost quit here lol), month 2: $387 in commissions, month 3: $1,240 in commissions, month 4: $2,100 in commissions\n\nTraffic went from 340 pinterest visitors in july to 4,800+ in october and the click-through rate to Amazon is consistently 2.8-3.2% which is way higher than my SEO traffic.\n\n**Key factors:**  with tailwinds smartpin feature I create 5-6 variations of each pin design quickly instead of spending an hour per pin in canva. The scheduling keeps me consistent even when I'm busy with other projects. Communities exposed my pins to thousands more people without spending on ads. Ghostwriter ai writes decent pin descriptions that are SEO-optimized which saves time\n\n**Metrics that matter:** monthly impressions: 890k in october, pin saves: 2,400+, monthly CTR to my site: 1.8%, amazon CTR from site: around 3%\n\nBiggest lesson is pinterest takes 6-8 weeks to gain traction so you cant judge results in the first month. Also product comparison pins (X vs Y) outperform generic roundup pins significantly. Vertical format 1000x1500 crushes square formats.\n\nFor affiliate marketers I'd say pinterest is seriously underrated compared to SEO right now.",

    "selftext": "This post is my small attempt to give back. I've been a lurker for a good while — picked up a lot of tips and recommendations from folks and figured it would be cool to show a small scale success (mid-5 figures).\n\nYou can see a screenshot of the that total here: https:// imgur. com/ a/ TSSTuST\n\n(just remove spaces, I didn't want to get in trouble for including link)\n\nThat represents one software product (no gatekeeping, it's Kajabi, I'll explain more below).\n\nBetween software, Amazon, and courses, my affiliate income has sat around $30k/yr for just over 5 years now. It's gone as high as $55k, and as low as $18k - but never back to zero, which is honestly kind of crazy. I'd say in total it's just over $148k as of writing this.\n\nSo, what the heck has actually worked for me?\n\nAnd why bother sharing this info?\n\nWHAT'S WORKED:\n\n* YouTube — no duh here, but I have been surprised by what has worked. Long-form (like 20+ min) videos that are low quality (just me and a bad mic and some screensharing software) have VASTLY out-performed highly edited videos that are shorter (5-12 min range). I even dumped $7k into video editing last year and saw almost no returns (yet) on that investment because they just don't convert. Idk, maybe great edits lower trust, but this is encouraging if you don't have much to start with.\n* LinkedIn SEO — so you know how reddit shows up for so many things on google? Well guess what, LinkedIn does too. This has been my secret weapon for about 2 years now. It's honestly going down, but if you want to squeeze some life out of it - all I did was write my review content on LinkedIn. I kept it shorter than a typical blog post (\\~300 words) and didn't include images or anything. But my posts ranked HIGH. A single post form 2022 has cleared me about $200/mo on autopilot. I'm obviously not going to share what I reviewed because it's still paying me free money haha.\n* High ticket sticky products — I hate even using that word high-ticket because it's been associated with such scammers, but the truth is products like the Kajabi ($2000/yr software) is extremely sticky. Once someone buys it, they stay on for years (which is why that alone has been awesome). I will say, there are some services that work the same way (usually agency focused) where you can get a cut of big spend for months, and sometimes years. The only ones I've made work were from irl relationships though, so I can't tell you exactly how to replicate. Just know, 1 big sale makes up for hundreds of smaller ones.\n   * Here is the exact campaign that's earned the $ in the screenshot  https:// app. kajabi. com/ r / vJSjoiwz/t/dyrmjuw3\n\nWHAT HASN'T WORKED:\n\n* TikTok or IG — I don't spend much time on those platforms, so I probably just never learned how to make them work, but even the shorts I recorded would perform better on YouTube (click wise, not view count wise).\n* Traditional blogging — now, I will still get amazon assoc. money from blogs (maybe $10-40/day), but ALL of that is from articles that are 2-3+ years old. Nothing I've publishing recently has gotten me anything. Idk, blame AI or saturation, but it feels like that part of the funnel is dead for now.\n\nWHY BOTHER SHARING:\n\n* I physically hate bad/outdated advice. Obv it's a waste of time to get mad at the internet haha, but seriously, so much of the \"tried and true\" stuff just doesn't work anymore. It's a waste of time and money. And people actually need good affiliate stuff (when I had a content agency, I desperately wanted trustworthy people talking about my stuff and was happy to pay them 30%, but man is that hard to find).\n* Product sales &gt; affiliate marketing. Yep, I don't know (personally) any good affiliate marketers who didn't end up going all in on their own product or service eventually. The better you get at promoting something, the more it makes sense to put that effort towards your own stuff. That's not to say don't do am, just know that once you get really good - you're probably going to want to shift.\n* Talk about fewer products (I was going to include a \"what I would do differently\" section, but this was the only point that really mattered). 80% of my aff income has come from 5 products. The caveat is that I talked about them A LOT. Online and in person. They were actually good, and they actually made sense to recommend to my network (other writers, content folks, etc.). Look for the low-hanging fruit in your own life - and then stick to it.\n\nWrote this while I'm waiting for an oil change. Feel free to ask questions if there are any, but if you're just going to be mean or unhelpful, keep that to yourself. ✌️",

    "selftext": "I’m a retired U.S. Army veteran who started diving into affiliate marketing after 23 years of military life and a short stint working remotely for someone else.\n\nStarting this journey in my 40s taught me a LOT and honestly, I wish someone had been brutally honest with me before I began. Maybe it would have saved me months (or years) of frustration.\n\nHere’s what I wish someone had told me:\n\n**1. “Affiliate marketing isn’t passive… at first.”**\n\nAt first, it feels like you’re spinning your wheels, building pages, writing emails, learning systems. It takes real work before anything “hands-off” happens.\n\n**2. “Shiny object syndrome will wreck you.”**\n\nThere’s always a new product, a new course, a new “secret method.” Chasing everything burns time and money. Pick one good system and go deep.\n\n**3. “You don’t have to be a tech wizard.”**\n\nI thought I needed crazy tech skills. Truth is, beginner-friendly tools exist now (like drag-and-drop page builders) that make it way easier than it used to be.\n\n**4. “Mindset matters way more than tactics.”**\n\nWhen you’re older, doubt creeps in hard: “Am I too late?” “Am I too old for this?” Trust me, it’s never too late if you’re consistent. Most people quit just before it clicks.\n\n**5. “Help people first, and the money follows.”**\n\nPeople can smell desperation from a mile away. Focus on solving real problems, recommending tools you actually believe in, and building trust. That’s where real commissions come from.\n\nI’m two years into this journey now, living abroad in Poland, and supporting my family while working online. It’s been worth every struggle, but if you’re just starting (especially later in life), go in with your eyes wide open.\n\nIf anyone’s thinking about starting or feeling stuck, happy to chat or share what systems/tools actually help me get started.\n\nWhat’s the biggest myth or misconception YOU had before starting online? ",

    "selftext": "I see so many posts from people wanting to start, but are getting overwhelmed and frustrated. Affiliate marketing is a simple concept and you can break it down into a couple of easy steps to become successful.\n\nMost people should be able to follow these steps, but the key is to actually make plan, write down your goals, break them up into actionable tasks, start executing and holding yourself accountable.\n\nNow, there's basically two ways to make money in the affiliate game:\n\n1. Send organic traffic to affiliate offers\n2. Send paid traffic to affiliate offers\n\n**For organic traffic this would be your simple game plan:**\n\n1. Pick an evergreen market and a niche within that market.\n2. Setup a website (I use [Systeme](https://gosysteme.com) it's free).\n3. Create awesome content around the big issues in your niche, solving the problems of your target audience and answering their questions (keyword research).\n4. Add affiliate links to offers relevant to your content.\n5. Repurpose your content in YouTube videos. tiktoks, Pinterest, etc.\n6. Promote your content. Link to your website and videos, never direct link to the offer.\n7. Invest your money into content outsourcing and ads, to grow quicker and scale your business.\n\nYou can find free YouTube tutorials on all of these steps. No need to buy courses from guru's.\n\nAgain, this looks easy but will take a lot of work! And you'll need patience. To get traction with organic traffic takes months.\n\nWrite down where you want to be a year from now. Then make a plan to get to that goal (use the steps above). Split them up in actionable tasks and make monthly, weekly and daily planning, set targets. I use [Notion](https://notion.so) for this.\n\nStick to your planning and reward yourself after completing tasks. Treat it like a business.\n\nP.S. If you like I could do one for paid traffic as well.\n\nEdit: you asked for it, so here it is: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Affiliatemarketing/comments/11yqzez/your\\_simple\\_plan\\_for\\_paid\\_traffic\\_affiliate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Affiliatemarketing/comments/11yqzez/your_simple_plan_for_paid_traffic_affiliate/)",

    "selftext": "I've been in the affiliate marketing game for about a year now, driven by the dream of ditching my soul-sucking 9-to-5. After experimenting with a ton of programs, I've finally honed in on three that are consistently delivering results. Here's the scoop:  \n  \n1. **Personal Finance App**: This one's a gem, bringing in around $4k monthly with a sweet 30% recurring commission. It's a breeze to promote, especially with the growing interest in financial literacy. I focus on platforms like Instagram and YouTube, sharing tips on budgeting and saving, and subtly weaving in the app as a must-have tool.  \n  \n2. **Digital Course Platform**: Earning me about $2.5k monthly with a 40% commission, this platform is a hit among aspiring entrepreneurs and lifelong learners. I create content around skill-building and career advancement on LinkedIn and TikTok, positioning the platform as the go-to resource for upskilling.  \n  \n3. **Niche Software Tool**: This one's pulling in $2.8k monthly with a hefty one-time payout. It's a bit more niche, but the high payout makes it worth it. I target specific forums and subreddits where enthusiasts hang out, offering genuine advice and slipping in the tool as a game-changer.  \n  \nFocusing on these three has really streamlined my strategy and boosted my income. If you're feeling overwhelmed by too many programs, maybe try narrowing down to a few that align with your interests and audience. Happy marketing!",

    "selftext": "I did a [post yesterday about organic traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Affiliatemarketing/comments/11xu0js/your_simple_game_plan_for_organic_traffic/) and you asked for a paid traffic plan, so here it is...\n\nThese steps will be a bit more difficult, because it involves tracking and multiple platforms like ad networks that all have a certain learning curve. But if you're willing to put in the time to learn, the payoff can be huge. This is because paid traffic is scalable.\n\nLet's say you start with a test budget of $5 per day and after 2 weeks you optimized your campaign based on your tracking data, so that it yields $8 on average for every $5 spent (ROAS, return on ad spend). There's no one stopping you to scale to $500 a day or even $5,000 a day.\n\nOf course you will need cashflow to scale and there's a limit to the volume you can get on the network. Offers can also have a cap on how many leads/sales they can handle. So always ask your AM before you start scaling. This is also a good time to ask for a payout bump! ;)\n\nNote: Unlike organic traffic (which will only cost you time) you'll need some capital to get into the paid traffic game. Tracking software is a must and you will need an initial testbudget.\n\n**For paid traffic this would be your simple game plan:**\n\n1. Register as a business. This will greatly help you get into affiliate networks, especially with paid traffic, because you won't have a content site to show them. It's relatively cheap to get a US LLC. or UK LTD.\n2. Buy a top level domain and email for your business (namecheap.com).\n3. Create a professional looking website for your business, explaining how you do media buying and performance marketing. Fake it till you make it. (you can do this for free at gosysteme.com)\n4. Pick a niche. You can probably make anything work, but good niches for paid traffic are:  financial trading, dating, sweepstakes, insurance, health/weight loss, skincare, bizz op, crypto, sports. (I've personally had a lot of success with financial trading offers).\n5. Apply for affiliate networks that have offers in your niche with your new business email. Some examples are Golden Goose, MaxBounty, Zeydoo, ClickDealer, CrakRevenue, LosPollos, AdsEmpire, Advidi. Some of these will be easier to get into than others. Make sure you look up tutorials on how to get accepted. You can also find offers for your niche on websites like Offervault.\n6. Talk to your affiliate manager, ask them what the best converting offers are and pick one.\n7. Find a traffic source. Check the TOS of the ad network. Not all networks allow all offers and marketing methods. There's different kinds of traffic like pop, push, display, redirect, native, mobile. Some will be better suitable for your offer than others. For example mobile is obviously good for app installs, native ads is good for financial and bizzop. Besides the big ones like Google and Meta there's many others like: PropellerAds, Revcontent, AdsTerra, Bidvertiser, Exoclick, etc..\n8. Buy tracking software. This is a MUST! If you don't track, you're shooting in the dark and can't optimize. I use Voluum, but there are others like RedTrack. These trackers offer integration with the big CPA networks (templates).\n9. Get hosting and landing page builder (free at [Systeme](https://gosysteme.com)).\n10. Think of a unique angle and create your landing page or multistep funnel.\n11. Get creatives from your network or make your own.\n12. Setup the campaign in your tracker and ad network.\n13. Optimize your campaign based on the data you gather. Only keep the stuff that's converting. Remove certain devices, countries, time of day, creatives, etc.\n14. Cut losers and scale winners.\n\nAlways keep testing even when your campaign is profitable. Split test offers, different landing pages, bidding strategies, etc. You can easily do this in your tracking software. This will improve your ROAS.\n\nOptional: buy a spy tool like Anstrex or Adplexity. See what's working for other and improve on that (don't steal campaigns).\n\nAs you can see there's a lot more involved here than getting organic traffic, but the rewards are far greater. Simply because of the fact you can scale your campaigns. There are super affiliates doing 6 figures a month by running paid ads.\n\nThere will be less free information about this on YouTube, but there are some forums like Stack That Money (STM), which are completely focused on paid traffic.\n\nI hope this helps. Give me a like if it does and feel free to ask questions.",

I may have to restart from scratch. \n\nBeen blocking bad taboola sites to make better use of budget. \n\nSolo ads got no sales but I got nearly 50% subscribers to my list out of total clicks purchased so hoping the drip campaign converts a handful of them.\n\nThe two weeks were tiring and frustrating but the commissions this week gave some glimmer of hope. \n\nI am also looking at different niches if I need to pivot, and also finding other affiliate products to be promoted to my slow growing list. \n\nI am open to hearing any feedback/suggestion to improve my ads or pivot or tips/tricks to breakeven and then profitable in this business. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Affiliate marketing is one of the easiest ways to earn passive income without handling inventory, dealing with customers, or creating products from scratch. And today, I’ll show you exactly how to reach your first $1,000 step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Pick the Right Affiliate Program**\n\nNot all affiliate programs are worth your time. The key is to \\*\\*choose high-paying products\\*\\* that people actually want.\n\n\\- Best picks? Digital courses, software subscriptions, or high-ticket items (think premium gadgets or business tools).\n\n\\- Sign up for platforms like Amazon Associates, Impact, PartnerStack, or ClickBank to get started.\n\n**Pro Tip:** Aim for commissions that pay at least $50 per sale so you only need 20 sales to hit $1,000.\n\n**Step 2: Create Simple Content That Converts**\n\nNo, you don’t need a fancy website or YouTube channel (but those help). You can start small:\n\n\\- Write Twitter threads breaking down useful tips related to the product.\n\n\\- Post on Quora answering questions with your affiliate link.\n\n\\- Make TikTok or Instagram reels showing how the product solves a problem.\n\n📌 **The trick?** Make helpful content, not just ads—people trust recommendations from real users.\n\n**Step 3: Drive Traffic With AI &amp; Automation**\n\nNo traffic = no sales. Here’s how to get eyeballs without spending hours grinding:\n\n\\- Use AI tools like ChatGPT or Copilot to write compelling product reviews.\n\n\\- Find trending topics with Google Trends or AnswerThePublic.\n\n\\- Automate posting using Buffer or Hootsuite.\n\n**Step 4: Scale Up &amp; Hit $1K Faster**\n\nOnce your first few sales come in, reinvest a small amount into paid ads:\n\n\\- Boost Twitter posts to get them seen by more people.\n\n\\- Run Pinterest ads for affiliate products (huge buyer intent!).\n\n\\- Use retargeting so people who clicked but didn’t buy see your offer again.\n\n**Final Thought: Why This Works**\n\nAffiliate marketing isn’t magicit’s strategy. The secret? Consistency + choosing the right product. If you follow this guide, it’s absolutely possible to hit your first $1,000 in passive income faster than you think.",

    "selftext": "I feel like affiliate marketing has already changed. Especially in this AI era it’s not like before.\n\nEarlier, we used to promote multiple products. You would take one offer from Clickbank, one from Impact, or some other offer from a different marketplace. \n\nBut I now see people winning by just picking one product and going all in.\n\nNew AI tools are launching every week. If you catch one tool early, when it’s new, and you dedicate yourself to it. The results gonna be different. If they have an affiliate program, join it. If not, reach out and ask to be a partner. \n\nOnce you become an affiliate or a partner, don't just be an affiliate. Instead, treat it like your own product.\n\nWhy am I saying this?\n\nI saw one guy on YouTube who has been dedicatedly promoting HighLevel for years. He even created a free course just to promote Highlevel in the backend as his core offer. \n\nAnother guy on Instagram only publishes clips, and at the end of every clip, he adds a CTA to promote Cheatbuster AI. \n\nSomeone else is just making videos about ElevenLabs. He has been making tutorials on ElevanLabs, and every video turns out to be promoting ElevanLabs.\n\nI tried the same approach. For the last 4–5 months, I focused on one product. Treated it like mine. Created content everywhere. And I got amazing results.\n\nI also think this is the right time to create directory sites. Almost every week, new AI products are coming out. These companies do aggressive marketing...and they want people to discover their softwares. So if you have a directory website in the AI niche with decent traffic...you can start making money both by listing and as an affiliate. Look at Futurepedia or FutureTools. They are just directories with huge traffic. Anyone can do it in a niche.\n\nThat’s what I feel is working now. What do you think? Do you see the same shift? Or do you think this is just temporary hype?",

    "selftext": "Hello (*this detailed case study is for those who want to have the precise numbers, costing and details of processes so they can build a content site that is monetised through affiliate marketing like Amazon and display ads like Ezoic)*\n\n**BASIC IDEA:** Before I share hard data with complete process how to achieve this. Let me share the basic idea.\n\n* Create a **content site with automated AI content** (cheap as compared to human writers, costs shared in this case study)\n* Build backlinks (details shared later in this case study with process)\n* Once it ranks and gets traffic from Google, **make money (minimal or management) with ads and affiliate marketing** (just like a rental property makes money while you sleep). $3,674/m in this case in 14 months.\n* **Sell the website** like you could sell your rental property\n\nIn this case study, we grew a site from **$0 to $3,674/m in 14 months (done cheaper, faster and in a more scalable way using automated AI content that beats Google updates)**\n\n**This is an AMA so feel free to ask questions.**\n\nInitially, the cost of building/acquiring, growing, managing/selling these affiliate sites used to be higher. However, with AI the costs have gone considerably down.\n\nIn comparison...\n\n* Old cost: $65,000 for 500,000 words\n* New cost: $5000 for 1,500,000 (words) 3 times number of words for 7.7% of the cost\n\nBased on this...\n\nWe have made a very IMPORTANT transition that has helped us maintain a **portfolio of 41+ websites with 5M+ organic hits per month**...\n\nContent production has moved from human written content to human assisted AI and now fully automated AI content. Becoming AI's ally was important otherwise, it had killed the content business.\n\n**MAIN IDEA:** Bulk publish easy to rank info articles that follow the same structure.

We used ChatGPT\n* Use Open AI and scripts to generate content for each section. Here, you will take input from the excel sheet that consists of the these keywords and related keywords\n* Generate CSV that has all the responses\n* Use WP ALL IMPORT to publish on WordPress Site\n\n**HOW TO DO IT?**\n\nExecuting this is reliant on three main variables. If you get these three right, the odds of success for such a project get higher.\n\n* Content Plan (like a blueprint of a rental property)\n* Content production (construction of a rental property)\n* Backlinks (marketing the rental property so people come see it as traffic and then rent it as conversions)\n\n**1. Content Plan**\n\nThis is like a blueprint for the whole project. One of the redditors commented on my previous case studies and summarised it perfectly. He said, it's like a map to a treasure while you're sailing on the ship. If this blueprint is right and you follow the directions (execute), you will get the treasure. Otherwise, you will waste your time, resources and skills chasing something you'll never get. After years of efforts your ship will sink. This is very well put. I would like to thank him for this.\n\nImportant elements of content plan are:\n\n* Niche selection: The criteria is:\n   * Enough total search volume\n   * Beatable competition\n   * Display ads allow that niche\n   * Enough affiliate programs\n   * Enough small sites to ensure that you can still make money at a small scale\n   * Enough big sites to ensure that you can make money at a big scale as well (this applies only when you wish to keep the project for long term and not sell when it's still small i.e. making less than $10,000 a month)\n* Identifying queries with similar article structure (tarot example shared in the main idea section)\n* Extracting queries in CSV\n* Manually clustering the similar ones together. Example: \"what does SUN mean in tarot\" and \"what do you mean by SUN in tarot\" are essentially the same\n* Finalising the articles based on above clustering and removing irrelevant ones\n* Categorising into categories/subcategories\n* Finalising pages (affiliates disclaimer, privacy policy, about us, contact, homepage content)\n\n**2. Content Production**\n\nYou need articles on the site that target keywords that people are searching on Google. The research for those keywords was done in the previous step. This step explains how to write articles for those keywords so you can get traffic.\n\n* Reverse engineering competitors: analysing how the top ranking competitors are answering those queries in the form of articles\n* Analysing the structure: What's their intro like, what's the first section then the next and next\n* Compile this info to construct an article structure that covers everything and can be implemented to all the article topics (this is why we chose the topics that could be answered with the same article structure and are not too different)\n* Include semantically relevant entities (engineer prompt accordingly)\n* Ensure relevance to the main and subcategory and other articles within the same categories/subcategories\n\n**3. Backlinks**\n\nNow that you have articles written in step 2 content production, you need to market them. You reach out to other relevant/general websites that can write about similar topics as your website and add a link pointing to your site in their post. This is called a backlink.\n\nHere's a quick tip: Reach out to prospects and clearly ask if they offer a sponsored post. It makes things much easier and saves time.\n\nHere's the criteria for the backlinks:\n\n* Niche relevant or general sites\n* DR greater than 15 (Ahrefs)\n* Search traffic greater than 250 (Ahrefs)\n* Content based\n* Dofollow\n* Indexed\n* Anchor text that is relevant\n* Permanent\n\n**Generating Prompts and Scripting for Bulk Content Production**\n\nThis step explains how to generate content with ChatGPT so you can generate content that ranks. Remember, there is no use to target topics or produce content that is NOT going to get traffic.\n\nThe prompt engineering is highly dependent on what the competitors are doing. You have to analyse things like tone, structure, flow of sentences, paragraphs and general outline of the article. Devise prompts for each section and compare it with the competitors to get something as close BUT BETTER than that. Remember that in order to rank, you can be different in a way that it's better than the competitors. However, do NOT be too different. Otherwise, you won't rank.\n\nAs far as the script is concerned, it would be hard to explain it here. But, imagine...\n\n* Excel sheet\n* Column 1: Main keywords\n* Column 2: Secondary keywords\n* Column 3: Section 1 of article e.g. intro (generated based on a unique prompt to this that takes input from column 1 and 2)\n* Column 4:  Section 2 of article e.g. first heading (generated based on a unique prompt to this that takes input from column 1 and 2)\n* So and so forth to finish all sections of the article\n\nThis excel sheet is connected with OpenAI's API and the formula is added to each cell, it interacts with the API and sends request to produce the content using prompt coded into that formula and input taken from column 1 and 2.\n\nResult: A CSV that consists of thousands of rows, each representing one article. Each row consisting of multiple columns. Each column representing a section of that article.\n\n**Bulk Content Publishing on WordPress**\n\nNow, you will have 1000s of articles. You can't manually upload them to WordPress. It would take a lot of time. This step explains how to do it in a matter of seconds in an automated way.\n\nUsing the CSV in the above step, you can use WP All import (WordPress plugin) to bulk publish the posts.\n\nIt would be redundant to explain the process here as you can easily check out a simple explainer YouTube video on this.\n\n**Submitting and Indexing**\n\nOnce you publish the content, Google needs to know that it exists. Otherwise, how will it rank, right?\n\nThis step explains how to submit and index.\n\nUse Google Developers API and RankMath to index the generated posts. Again, a simple Google search can return a guide that can help you do this. Writing this here is inefficient.\n\n**Conversion Rate Optimisation**\n\nIn this step, you optimise your content and page in a way so people click the maximum number of ads and affiliate offers so you can make more money.\n\nThe conversion rate optimisation of this project was done somewhere in around 12th month onwards. The RPM in previous recent months was around $10. But, with this CRO it increased to $17.\n\nWe did the following:\n\n* Ads and affiliate offers in the sidebar\n* Call to action for relevant affiliate offers in the form of a beautiful table right after the intro section\n\n**Costing**\n\n*Expenses*\n\n* Content: Almost 1,500,000 words\n* Content cost: $7500 (includes API tokens, researching comp., devising structure, prompts, publishing, everything etc.)\n* Backlinks that we built and paid for: 75\n* Average cost per backlink: $110\n* Total cost for backlinks: $8,250\n* Other admin: $1000\n* Total: $7,500 + $8,250 + $1000 = $16,750\n\n*Return*\n\n* Earnings (affiliate and display): $9,728.69\n* Sold: $108,000 (private sale)\n* Total: $117,728.69\n\n*Net*\n\n* Net: $117,728.69 - $16,750 = $100,978.69\n* ROI: 602%\n* Duration: 14 months\n\n**Way Forward and Analysis**\n\nThe fundamental shift in our approach was necessary. Producing content for brands and affiliate sites got super expensive and unable to rank with human writers. It killed a lot of big SEO projects in the industry.\n\nThe pivot enabled us to produce content faster, cheaper and in a more scalable way with higher quality.\n\nWith this approach, the goal is to scale the portfolio even further and hopefully publish more case studies of exits.\n\nIf you have any feedback/questions - feel free to let me know. This is an AMA. I would be happy to answer.\n\nCheers and I wish you best of luck to build your own affiliate website for passive income.",

I quit after December/ January because I was awful at managing it and I was too lazy at the time. Here I am now, coming back to affiliate marketing to give it another go, I checked what my stats were in the last year out of curiosity. Turns out, I actually made $1.60 in revenue. I had no idea that people actually bought something from me, but thinking about it just made me so excited\n\nNow I KNOW $1.60 is basically nothing, but for me, it shows that some people are actually willing to look at the things you put out. I know that if I continued to put in the time and effort, something rewarding can come out it.\n\nI'm really inspired right now, and I have been focused on making content.

    "selftext": "I wanted to share an affiliate marketing trick that has served me well over the years that I haven't seen anyone else in the sub mention yet. Many seasoned marketers already do this, but it's worth mentioning to the newbies as it's a crucial first step to success. When joining an affiliate program, most will either allow you to choose a username, or will assign one to you that can be changed later. \n\n\n\nSo, then the affiliate link you end up promoting looks something like \"**username3452.affiliateprogram.com**\" or \"**affiliateprogram.com/id=username3452**\". This looks quite obviously like an affiliate link and will turn off a lot of people from clicking if they think it looks shady or unprofessional, especially if you choose something that to you seems like no big deal, like \"oldfart71\" or \"stinkykitty27\".\n\n  \nThat may be your consistent username on your socials, but should NOT be used when being the representative (affiliate) or a business promoting a product or service.\n\n  \nSo, the trick is to, instead of using your normal username, enter something that looks like it would be a natural part of the website url. Since most affiliate links involve joining a program try using something like \"join\", \"register\" or \"signup\" as your USERNAME, so your affiliate link will now look like \"**affiliateprogram.com/id=join**\" &lt;-- looks like a normal signup link, right? :)\n\n  \nSince my name is Daniel, the last program I joined automatically used my first name in the affiliate url, so I changed it immediately before doing any promotion at all. It works VERY well and I recommend doing it whenever you can. Obviously not all programs allow a change, but many do, so just change it whenever you can to make it easier to promote the link.\n\n  \nI wish you all the best!!",

    "selftext": "Been 4 years in this affiliate industry and I noticed a common pain is that big affiliate networks like Rakuten, CJ, Impact won't make it easy for you to create a publisher account and start making money, especially if you're just beginning. I've tried Rakuten &amp; CJ both as an affiliate and advertiser - and you might think that the registration process is easy, but trust me - after couple of days you will receive an email saying your account get banned for not meeting minimum requirement (min 500 subscirbers/traffic/follower) or violating their affiliate policy.\n\nThat's why since moving to SaaS as an advertiser, I saw a good thing which is SaaS companies make their affiliate programs way easier and more beginner-friendly (not to mention their attractive commission rate) then traditional ecommerce/dtc brands. And while researching for our own program, I put some extra work and [made this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11_lU1dNvbCSkyptNXXIu8en_fDN0FeeTjM8dnbpLmo8/edit?usp=sharing). It's a list of top Shopify app's affiliate programs (including our own) that have very attractive commission offers (around 20 - 60% recurring - meaning you can earn commission so long as your referral still in a paid plan) and EXTREMELY BEGINNER friendly - you dont have to be a KOL or blogger with huge traffic to join. I also checked every single one and listed out why they are worth trying.\n\nAll the programs I listed on the sheet are 3rd-party apps from Shopify - good for you if you already familiar with Shopify, but if not then you can gg or chatgpt it - it's not a complicated things to learn. Shopify and the app ecosytem that comes with it is not new, but if you ask me are they still potential to invest then I'm gonna say yes (Shopify does public their financial reports so you can go and check if they are still growing or not). Good luck!\n\nTL;DR: The link is a google spreadsheet with 20 best shopify apps' affiliate programs that are beginner friendly and come with generous offer. And part 2 will come\n\n**UPDATE:** For those who ask, the potential users of these apps are Shopify merchants - who use Shopify platform to start an ecommerce website",

So with advent of AI they have brough back the updated culture of 'Featured Snippet' with some major changes to it.\n\nHere's a practical example from one of our recent works in January👇\n\nIf you search for 'How Long Does It Take to See Results from ZO Skin Health' you'll see a [featured snippet like this](https://prnt.sc/kVXUiCfFvF8Q)\n\nThis featured snippet shows the answers and links back to the top 5 articles ranking on SERP on this subject (yes ranking). \n\nThe second link that says 'Initial Results (2-4) weeks' as well, links to [1 article only, which is ours.](https://prnt.sc/pcIqWJc2mn3b)\n\nProof that it is our article (highlighted the part being shown in the result): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wn6bfQESJzYAPFMDmuspygIVxUBTlX_PwBmub2DOmDI/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nNow 80% of our works were optimized for Google and not exactly for AEO or Snippets because we wanted page views and not quick answers. However for some of our smaller local service clients, &amp; saas, this worked pretty well. \n\nOne example of SaaS client where our writing, and optimization worked is [this property management software on SERP](https://prnt.sc/Z22PbFLBIr9_)\n\nNow that we saw that we can rank on AI overview here are few things you should do to try &amp; optimize your chances.\n\n1. Use proper structured data\nFor example in the first one there was 'ListItem' &amp; for second  was 'WebPage' schema added apart from other schemas. It's important that Google knows what's he ranking.\n\n2. Forget writing just after the start\nI remember doing this 'sandwich formula' of writing info content. Infact one of my early sites that I have sold now, was built on this formula of 'writing answers directly' under the H1 for example: \n\nFor 'Is it safe to feed leaves to your pet dragon?'\n\nArticle starts with- \n\nPet dragons are one of the most popular type of 'pets' widely accepted globally, due to it's inert nature, and ability to survive in domestic treatment.\n\nYes, it's safe to feed leaves to your pet dragon, as in their natural habitat, they would anyways have those.\n\nThen.....\n\nThis formula has been history now, and you can answer comprehensively under any headings. A small trick to do this👇\n\n1. Ask AI to write the topic in detail of 1000 words.\n2. Then ask it to summarise the answer in a paragraph of no more than 3 sentences. \n\nYou can take inspiration or directly copy that paragraph only as it's written by AI following what AI's prefer to give in snippets nowadays.\n\n3. Always make sure the content is in active voice.\nVoice search, AI results don't prefer contents written in passive. It's easier to speak in active &amp; so, write in active.\n\nTry these and let me know how it goes?\n\nKeep writing!",

    "selftext": "I've been doing affiliate marketing for about 18 months and made some pretty expensive Pinterest mistakes along the way. Sharing what I learned so others don't waste months like I did.\n\nFirst mistake was thinking Pinterest was like Instagram. Spent months trying to build engagement and followers instead of focusing on search traffic. Pinterest users aren't there to chat, they're researching solutions to problems.\n\nSecond mistake was writing terrible pin descriptions. My early pins basically said \"check out this awesome financial tool!\" Nobody searches for \"awesome tool.\" They search for \"ways to save money\" or \"free life hacks.\"\n\nThird was inconsistent posting. Would create 5 pins one week, then nothing for two weeks. Pinterest algorithm punished me hard for this.\n\nWhat finally worked was treating it like SEO, not social media. Started using Tailwind to keep posting consistent and let their AI write more search-friendly descriptions. The difference was night and day.\n\nNow Pinterest is actually my second-highest converting channel after organic search. Took way longer than it should have because I was approaching it completely wrong.\n\nAnyone else make similar mistakes when starting with Pinterest affiliate marketing?",

Or do I just need an agency/freelancer for this?\n\nAny recommendations or experiences would be great, TIA\n\nUpdate: Didn’t expect such a reaction to this post ha. Ended up going with Endorsely and it’s been working pretty well so far - got 3 proactive affiliates (and a couple tire kickers lol) from probably an hours worth of outreach. Just got my second referral through so thanks for the help :D",

They listen. They sense what others do not yet see.\n\nThey spot a question posed in a corner of Reddit at midnight.\nA comment lost under a YouTube video.\nA sentence in a tweet, which reeks of frustration, doubt, “I don’t know what to do anymore”.\n\nAnd there… they arrive.\n\nNot to sell.\nBut to put a clear solution in front of someone who is really struggling.\n\nNot a sales funnel.\nNot an empty promise.\nJust: “Here, try this. It might help you.”\n\nAnd that's where everything changes.\nBecause when you solve real pain, you sell without selling.\nYou become more than an affiliate. You become a reference.\n\n\n---\n\nMost will never understand that.\nThey believe it’s a question of platforms, algorithms, hacks.\n\nWhen in truth, it's just a question of precision. Attention. Social intelligence.\n\nDo you want results?\nStart by closing your mouth and opening your eyes.\n\nSpot people who are suffering. Provides a real solution.\nDo it 10 times. 100 times. Every day.\nAnd watch the rest of the game collapse in front of you.\n\n\n---\n\nI'm not here to make noise.\nI am here to help some people open their eyes.\n\nBecause affiliation is not a business of links.\nIt’s a business of conscience.\n\nAnd the conscious dominate the noisy.
