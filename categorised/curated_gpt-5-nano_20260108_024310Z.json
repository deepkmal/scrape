      "selftext": "**MODS - I DO NOT WORK AT ANY OF THESE COMPANIES. THIS IS A HELPFUL POST - NOT PROMOTIONAL**\n\nI run a digital marketing agency and have worked in b2b marketing for 15 years. I've been an individual contributor, Director, VP, and now a CEO. Throughout my career, I've used pretty much every saas tool you can think of. I just started using reddit for business, so I figured I'd put together a list of my favorites with the hope it helps you at some point. My gift as a newbie.  \n\n\n**Hubspot**: You can't beat the best. Hands down the best marketing automation platform and overall \"source of information\" for any marketing team. I've used Pardot, Marketo, and Act On and Hubspot is by far the best. It's a big expense, so I recommend teams that just need email marketing to go to the next tool on my list.  \n\n\n**Apollo.io:** Combine Zoominfo with Salesloft and you have Apollo. I think it's still $99/month for unlimited email credits from the contact database. It's a great email marketing tool. Has all the functionality of other sales engagement tools at a fraction of the price.  \n\n\n**Gong.io:** I know Gong is mostly a sales tool but I've used it for voice of customer research. As good as I think I am writing copy, nothing is better than taking the words right out of the customer's mouth. Much of my best content and highest-performing landing pages all started with a Gong recording.  \n\n\n**Winware.ai**: Winware is my new favorite for on-site lead capture. I've used modals, newsletter signups, and demo forms to generate leads from my content and never got above a 1% conversion rate. Winware offers visitors an incentive for providing feedback on a blog post but requires them to provide their business email address first. It's the best lead hook on my website.  \n\n\n**Session Rewind**: Think HotJar but better. I use Session Rewind to watch videos of people on my landing page. You can tell I like to have a solid mix of quant and qual data. Google Analytics can't tell me exactly what people do on my site.  \n\n\n**BigMarker**: I just started using this one for webinars and I've been really impressed. It's expensive. Way more than GotoWebinar or Zoom Webinars but I like that it's a dedicated tool and not part of a suite of products.  \n\n\n**Unsplash**: Best and cheapest stock image library I've found. I signed up for a premium account for $50/year I think and use it every time I need stock images for ads and landing pages.  \n\n\n**ChatGPT 4**: Obvious one, but seriously, if you aren't using ChatGPT 4 - NOT GPT 3 - you're behind the curve. Half of the marketers I know are using this to write all their content now. It's not perfect by any stretch but it's a must use in any marketer's toolkit. AI is going to take our jobs sooner than later anyway. Might as well lean into it.  \n\n\n**ClickUp**: My favorite project management tool. It's so much better than Monday.com. I run my entire company through ClickUp and I'm still on the free plan. Great integrations and so easy to use. I was a Monday user for a long time but the switch was worth it.  \n\n\n**Ahrefs**: I know there's a Semrush v Ahrefs debate but I'm firmly on the side of Ahrefs. It's the best tool I've used for SEO. Gives me all the information I need on my site and competitors. I have an entire SEO toolkit that I'll save for another time, but Ahrefs is a great start.  \n\n\nI tried to mix in some known and lesser-known tools in there. Hopefully, it can help some of my fellow marketers.",

      "title": "Throwaway: Instagrams entire future depends on automation (I saw it firsthand)",
      "selftext": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. Up until 2 months ago I was on the M&amp;A (mergers &amp; acquisitions) team at Meta. I left to work for another company in the social media space, but while I was there I saw enough on the inside to understand how Instagram really thinks about growth and where they’re steering things. Figured I’d share some context because I keep seeing the same bad advice and the same people getting burned.\n\nFirst off, I can’t tell you who you should use, but I can tell you who you should avoid.\n\nPath Social, Kicksta, Upgrow, Wolfgrow. None of these are real growth solutions. They’re glorified bot farms. They recycle fake accounts from overseas, route them through the same IP pools, and hammer Instagram’s flagged API calls until your account gets flagged too. They don’t build communities, they build fake shells that eventually collapse. And yes, Meta knows. These companies have been on compliance watchlists for years.\n\nSo why are they still around? Simple: ads. Path Social in particular spends a ridiculous amount of money on ads with Meta, and that basically buys them time. Meta cashes the checks while quietly banning or throttling the accounts tied to them. It’s a double dip. They profit from the ad spend, then profit again when those same customers crawl back into official ads just to stay visible.\n\nHere’s the bigger truth. Meta doesn’t care about your follower count. They don’t care about influencers gaming the system. The company lives and dies by two numbers:\n\nAverage time on app. That’s the stat they brag about at quarterly shareholder calls. If they can say “time spent per user is up,” Wall Street is happy.\n\nAd revenue. Because that’s the entire business model.\n\nEvery algorithm tweak, every policy change, every shadowban serves those two goals. Anything that doesn’t feed into them gets killed off. That’s why 99% of these “10k followers in a week” type tools never last.\n\nNow here’s the part most people don’t see. Without breaking NDAs, I can say this much: there are exactly two companies worldwide that Meta has quietly allowed to keep operating under a controlled test umbrella. Both are small AI-driven firms. One is based in St. Louis. The other in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nThese companies don’t blast bots or fake engagement. They built server systems that mimic human behavior so closely that Meta can pitch the results as “increased time spent on platform” in their shareholder decks. Both price their services at $300+ a month, not because it costs that much to run, but to keep the user base small and serious. Only accounts with deeper pockets and long-term goals get in. That exclusivity keeps them safer than the mass-market tools that draw attention.\n\nThe Scottsdale company has already been acquired by Meta. Their paying users were grandfathered in and now basically run the software for free under Meta’s controlled testing. If you dig around Crunchbase you can probably figure out which company it is by looking at Meta’s recent acquisitions.\n\nThe St. Louis company is still independent, but here’s the kicker: it already has investment money from Meta and is under contract for business marketing work across the Midwest. Part of me has always wondered if companies like this are basically shells Meta sets up to experiment through, but the outright acquisition of the Scottsdale firm kind of kills that theory. (Shells aren’t really my area, so I’ll admit that part goes above my head.) Either way, it feels inevitable the St. Louis one gets folded in soon too.\n\nThis fits into the bigger roadmap. Instagram has neglected the business and influencer space for years, and now they’re correcting course. Instagram also knows it isn’t the app people get “big” on anymore. Most creators blow up on TikTok first, then spin up an Instagram that just bleeds off followers from their TikTok links. And Meta hates that. Trust me, they know exactly where they stack up in the social media hierarchy right now. I had been with them for a long time, and honestly it’s kind of hurt to watch them morph from a photo app, to a video app, to a live streaming app, and now into a business app. That shift was part of why I left. It feels washed up to me. More power to the brands and business owners who get in early — I know a lot of big-name brands are already using the St. Louis company, so good for them — but it didn’t align with my own career goals. I’m a principled man, lol.\n\nGoing into 2030, Meta is clearly steering Instagram toward being the platform for brands, influencers, and businesses. TikTok will keep dominating the “average person” space with broad organic reach. Instagram is doubling down on being the go-to platform for businesses that need precision — targeting exact demographics, warming up leads, and converting followers into paying customers.\n\nSocial media is splitting into two lanes. TikTok for reach. Instagram for revenue. And Meta is betting heavy on automation to make it happen. Not bots, not spammy junk, but AI systems that drive engagement in ways that can be tied back to sales. From an M&amp;A perspective, this isn’t about giving small creators a fair shot. It’s about building a suite of business tools Meta can sell, scale, and present to Wall Street as the future of digital advertising.\n\nSo if you’re looking at the landscape long-term, hedge your bets accordingly. Instagram is positioning itself as the business platform of the 2030s. The tools they’re rolling out for businesses are way beyond anything they’ve done before, and honestly, they’re impressive.\n\nAt the end of the day, Meta doesn’t want to fight automation. They want to own it. And once these acquisitions are fully folded in, they will.\n\nI had this posted in r/instagrammarketing within 5 days it became the top post in that subreddit, the next day that entire subreddit got banned. So take this information as you will, but there was definitely Meta intervention there. The sub had over 270k members…. ",

      "selftext": "Good day Redditors.\r  \n\r  \nI have written posts about how we approach advertising to drive success for our clients and our brands.\r  \n\r  \nThis post will be about a summary of learnings from spending over $20M in ad spend.\r  \n\r  \nI know it's not that much ad spend, there are people who manage this a month.\r  \n\r  \nTo be quite fair, 60% of the ad spending has come from this year.\r  \n\r  \nSo, let's start.\r  \n\r  \nI remember the early days of advertising in Meta. Back in 2018, literally anyone who had a somewhat decent product where able to generate sales.\r  \n\r  \nWhat was even more fun was that It was done with quite a few ads.\r  \n\r  \nThen all of the advertising was about \"hacking the ads manager\"\r  \n\r  \nTesting interests\r  \n\r  \nCreating lookalikes from followers, website visitors, purchases, email lists, etc.\r  \n\r  \nBack in 2018, we were able to scale a bike company brand from $20k a month to $240k a month in just 10 months.\r  \n\r  \nWe found one ad, and we tried to spend as much money as possible with that ad doing all sorts of \"hacking ads manager\" stuff.\r  \n\r  \nThis was the year when we decided to launch sales on Halloween and generated $100k in just a few days.\r  \n\r  \nOur black friday that year didn't even come close.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward to 2020.\r  \n\r  \nThis was still before IOS, I noticed that it was tough to replicate the scaling with just one ad.\r  \n\r  \nIn 2020 we started to test new ads every month, I remember this vividly.\r  \n\r  \nCreated 3 ads for that month that we wanted to test, and we hit two winners.\r  \n\r  \nOne video, one image.\r  \n\r  \nWow... So that became our benchmark, test 2 new ads every month and still do \"hacking the ads manager\" trying to push these ads via interests, lookalikes, and duplicating campaigns from abo to CBO, to CBO from abo.\r  \n\r  \nThat time literally, our team spent at least 2 hours per day in Facebook ads manager trying to figure out the newest targeting hacks by using stacking.\r  \n\r  \nWe played around with interests stacks and lookalikes stacks.\r  \n\r  \nEven combo stacks. We really thought that this is what generates the best results.\r  \n\r  \nThen....\r  \n\r  \nArmageddon happened.\r  \n\r  \nIOS 14 Mother\\*\\*\\*er.\r  \n\r  \nThis update wiped our performance across all accounts like no other.\r  \n\r  \nWe thought that this was the extinction of Facebook ads.\r  \n\r  \nEveryone was screaming Facebook ads are dead.\r  \n\r  \nClients were dropping us left and right.\r  \n\r  \nThen after a month of horrible performance and losing clients, we still had to pay our people.\r  \n\r  \nWe understand that \"Hacking Facebook ads manager\" days have come to an end.\r  \n\r  \nWe started to test fewer interests but still kept the lookalikes. :D\r  \n\r  \nThis was the time when we started to test more ads - 4 a month.\r  \n\r  \nYes, we doubled the testing.\r  \n\r  \nIt's actually funny to look back, thinking that testing 4 ads a month was actual testing.\r  \n\r  \nWe are at the end of 2021.\r  \n\r  \nTesting about 8 new ads every month for our brand and our clients.\r  \n\r  \nMainly using a stack of interests and a stack of lookalikes.\r  \n\r  \nNow it's January 2022, we signed this one client with the capacity to create ads and we were also building our in-house content department in order to scale creative testing.\r  \n\r  \nWe analyzed:\r  \n\r  \nFacebook and Instagram content - what type of content are we seeing daily?\r  \n\r  \nTurns out we were seeing content that we were interested in.\r  \n\r  \nFacebook and Instagram ads - again, most of the ads that were shown to us and that we reacted to were the stuff that we were interested in.\r  \n\r  \nInteresting...\r  \n\r  \nThis is still January 2022.\r  \n\r  \nWhat if we start researching customer psychology and customer behavior and just understand what type of content our target customer likes to see? ( I Have a post on how we approach research, so I won't describe this in detail in this post).\r  \n\r  \nLet's create ads that speak to our target customers by introducing awareness stages\r  \n\r  \nUnaware ads - ads that take an unaware audience to most aware audience.\r  \n\r  \nProblem-aware - ads that talk to people who know about their problem.\r  \n\r  \nSolution-aware ads - ads that target people who understand that they have a problem but don't know which solution to choose.\r  \n\r  \nProduct aware - ads that target people who understand their problem and also know how that is the way on how to solve their problem but don't know which brand/product to choose.\r  \n\r  \nMost aware - people who already know everything about their problem, how to solve it, what product to choose, they are just waiting for the right time to buy from you.\r  \n\r  \nSo how can we test the content?\r  \n\r  \nOne thing is creating the ads another is testing it.\r  \n\r  \nWe had this complicated ad account structure, one campaign ABO campaign to test audiences, and one CBO for scaling the best audiences with the best ads.\r  \n\r  \nWe aimed to create 20 ads.\r  \n\r  \nThere was no way we could test 20 ads and interests on the ABO level, this was like lighting money on fire.\r  \n\r  \nThen we decided to use:\r  \n\r  \nOne CBO campaign.\r  \n\r  \nUse best-performing interests and lookalike combo stack and one broad ad set ( no targeting)\r  \n\r  \nTo test how the ads messages work.\r  \n\r  \nWhy no targeting?\r  \n\r  \nWell, by doing content analysis, we were interested in testing the theory of is the algorithm capable of delivering our ads to the right customer without us doing the targeting side.\r  \n\r  \nWe launched 3 video ads that were talking about the customer problem and educating how this product will solve it.\r  \n\r  \nOn day one, we are getting sales with interest and the lookalike combo stack is winning.\r  \n\r  \nDay two combo stack still winning by a lot.\r  \n\r  \nOn day three, our broad ad set was picking up more and more sales.\r  \n\r  \nDay four, our broad ad set, took 80% of that day's spend, leaving the combo stack in the dust.\r  \n\r  \nDay 5, our combo stack dot us one sale.\r  \n\r  \nDay 6, we turned off our combo stack and started creating new broad ad sets with new ad tests.\r  \n\r  \nIt took off.\r  \n\r  \nWe immediately did this for all of our accounts.\r  \n\r  \nSame result.\r  \n\r  \nImagine spending 4 years \"hacking the ads manager\" and seeing that no targeting is producing better results for niche markets than targeting.\r  \n\r  \nThat was a real eye-opener on what Facebook ads algorithm can do.\r  \n\r  \nSince January 2022, we have been spending more and more time researching and developing the ads than the actual Facebook ad account.\r  \n\r  \nWe have measured that, on average, we spend up to 10 minutes a day optimizing the accounts, and 2-3 hours are spent on researching and analyzing the data to create a better ad.\r  \n\r  \nOne of our first steps is to test 50-100 ads in the first month to understand what messaging hits.\r  \n\r  \nBy doing this, we are able to find winning messages really fast.\r  \n\r  \nWhat previously took 6-12 months now can be done in 1-3 months\r  \n\r  \nTesting a lot of ad messages provides you with a lot of winners.\r  \n\r  \nThen creating at least 10 variations on winning ads, you can come down to 1-3 messages that spend 60-80% of your daily budget, which you can comfortably scale.\r  \n\r  \nToday.\r  \n\r  \nIf you say that ad testing does not work. You clearly haven't spent enough time researching and testing multiple ad variations.\r  \n\r  \nThe algorithm has become more and more content-oriented.\r  \n\r  \nThis is the reason we are not experiencing shit days with meta like most of brands and advertisers do.\r  \n\r  \nYes, we have a few a month, but it's nowhere near the amount that I read on this Reddit channel.\r  \n\r  \nSo, to sum up what it takes to generate good results with Facebook ads.\r  \n\r  \nDaily research 1-3 hours.\r  \n\r  \nDaily ad creation 1-2 hours.\r  \n\r  \nDaily ad optimization of 5-10 minutes.\r  \n\r  \nAds is the targeting.\r  \n\r  \nUnderstanding your customers is by far the most important thing in order to create ads that they will react to.\r  \n\r  \nContent is king - that's why it's important to input hours and hours into content creation.\r  \n\r  \nFacebook is not rewarding mediocre input anymore.\r  \n\r  \nTop brands are still scaling.\r  \n\r  \nYou can do this too.\r  \n\r  \nKeep in mind this is just about Facebook ads, I'm not talking about what happens after the click, your website, your business numbers, upsells, crossells, email flows.\r  \n\r  \nSometimes I like to think about Facebook ads as salespeople.\r  \n\r  \nWe know that big businesses have whole sales departments generating sales every minute.\r  \n\r  \nIf you only rely on one salesperson, it's going to get burnt our calling the phone 24/7.\r  \n\r  \nThe same thought process can be applied to meta.\r  \n\r  \nThe more salespeople you have out here calling the phone, and knocking on doors, the more sales you are going to get.\r  \n\r  \nFind the right salespeople.\r  \n\r  \nThanks for reading.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm an ex-Meta engineer who spent 5+ years working on the ads algorithm team. And then I worked at Reddit as a Senior Engineer in their ads department as well.\n\nEdit: After leaving, I founded [Aimerce](http://aimerce.ai) to help Shopify brands fix the exact tracking and delivery issues I saw from the inside and honestly, it’s wild how many of the same patterns still show up.\n\nBased on my experience helping 120+ brands since leaving Meta, here's what actually works:\n\nI won't dive into details about idea validation or market fit—that should come before product creation. But if you already have a product in commerce or B2B, here's some underrated solutions to try to boost your rev:\n\n**Optimization**  \nFrom my time building Meta's ad delivery system, I know this is crucial. Your website needs perfect technical implementation or you're throwing money away. Key technical elements that feed into ad algorithms:\n\n* Server-side API integration (crucial since iOS 14)\n* First-party cookie implementation\n* Advanced matching parameters\n* Custom conversion events\n* Real-time event logging\n\nMost importantly: track every meaningful user interaction server-side. At Meta, we saw 3-4x better ad performance with proper server events vs client-side only.\n\n**First-Party Data Collection**  \nThis is what powers modern ad algorithms. Essential data points to collect:\n\n* User behavior patterns\n* Conversion paths\n* Time-to-conversion\n* Cart abandonment signals\n* Feature usage metrics\n\nPro tip: Log these events immediately server-side. There's a 30% data loss on average with client-side only. This means having your own first party data pixel or first party intelligence app instead of relying on third party pixels like the default you get from Meta, Google, or whatever ad platform you're using.\n\n**Algorithm Optimization**  \nHaving built these systems, here's what actually matters:\n\n* Event quality scores. These are more accurate when tracked server-side instead of a third party pixel.\n* Server-side conversion matching\n* Bidding strategy alignment\n* Creative performance signals. This one is most obvious.\n\nThe algorithm weighs server-sent signals 2-3x more than pixel data.\n\n**Email Engagement**  \nI'm a huge advocate of having a combination of paid and email marketing. When they work in tandem, you get the highest quality signals that can feed into each other for retargeting. Here's some flow that people usually miss:\n\n* abandoned cart for ecommerce\n* abandoned intent for b2b\n\nNote that abandoned cart/intent are explicitly different from abandoned checkout. At the checkout stage, you've already collected email address and have high-intent for conversion. Email marketing is going to be even more effective at the stage right before. For ecommerce, its going to be at the point of adding the cart. For B2B, it could be viewing the pricing page.\n\nMost people don't implement these flows because it often requires some manual work but if you're able to stitch user sessions across their history, you can use your cookies to understand if the visitor has shown interest in purchasing before and have a specific email flow for it! This is probably the most underrated solutions.\n\nPro Tip: Sync email engagement data back to ad platforms via server events. This improves targeting by 25-30%.\n\nThe key is quality first-party data feeding into platforms' algorithms. With proper implementation, I regularly see 2-3x ROAS improvement.\n\nWe’re seeing the same delivery issues pop up again and again especially in accounts using duplicated pixel setups or relying too heavily on GTM. At Aimerce, I've audited hundreds of Shopify brands this year alone, and it’s always the same root causes. Fix those and performance usually rebounds.\n\nMessage me if you need help with technical implementation details! I might do a dedicated post on this if there's interest!a",

So my job was to increase the amount of online leads they get.\n\nFirst thing i did apart from creating a social media strategy and fixing their website funnels was starting a blog for them. \n\nBasically this was a competitive industry that had very few thought leaders with authority online. I scanned the content online of competitors and realized how i can do things different. Because there was not enough thought leaders with authority, it left the end consumer uneducated about the industry.\n\nSo what i did was i built a very strong client avatar and identified the key pain points of the end consumer. I then created a content strategy (series of blog topics) that solve this problem for the consumer with information education\n\nI probably published around 10 articles each around 1000-2000 words by also looking at seo key word trends what people were searching for.\n\nOut of those 10 one of them really took off. It turned out that topic was the biggest pain point for customers and what they had been searching for online. And the article i wrote was seriously comprehensive step by step guide on how services in this industry work. I left nothing for thought, and didnt care about how long it would be because i knew the target client would value this. Article ended up around 2700 words. \n\nBecause no one in the industry wanted to reveal how their internal systems work (ie keep customer in the dark and charge what they want) we were the only people who had revealed this info it became the top search result on google rank for those specific keywords \n\nWhat made this quicker was i took the article and posted it on social media and then ran ads to that piece of content. This brought tones of traffic and increased our google rank credibility\n\nWe started getting 1000s of organic traffic every month from google alone, let alone traffic from paid ads\n\nIn the end of the article i just added a call to action related to the topic (ie find out more by speaking with our consultants)\n\nThat call to action link led to a lead capture form that gave them something in return like a quote\nThen from the quote they qualify the lead on a consultation call and close the deal\n\nThis translated to 1000s of leads and 100s of customers and millions of closed contracts over the course of few years. Each year the revenue doubled and its still bringing leads till today\n\nI just keep advertising it on social and change the creative video or post but they still lead to the same article\n\nFeel free to ask me anything!",

      "selftext": "I'm an SEO consultant who's been obsessing over why some content gets cited in ChatGPT/Perplexity and some doesn't. Since november 2024 I’ve been manually tracking this stuff and built a framework that works pretty consistently.\n\nTested it across 200+ pages. The patterns are honestly super clear once you see them.\n\nFirst thing I check: stat density. Pages need like 3-5 statistics per 1000 words minimum. Took one article that was getting cited maybe 2 out of 10 times. Added 6 stats throughout, didn't change anything else. Now it gets cited 8/10 times.\n\nNot just \"email marketing is effective\" but like \"B2B email open rates average 21.5%, Tuesday sends perform 18% better\" … that kind of specific stuff.\n\nLLMs seem to really prioritize quantifiable info. Pages with 5+ stats get cited like 3x more in my testing.\n\nSecond thing: quote ready sentences. Your key insights gotta be able to stand alone. Bad version: \"The challenge with AI optimization is that it requires understanding how context affects processing.\" Good version: \"Context is the biggest challenge in AI optimization.\"\n\nChatGPT literally lifts standalone sentences word for word. If you bury your insights in these long complex paragraphs they're basically invisible to LLMs.\n\nPages with 5+ sentences that work as standalone quotes get cited way more .. like 3.2x from what I've tracked.\n\nThird: recency signals. So this one surprised me but content from the last few months gets cited noticeably more than older stuff even when the older content ranks better. Newer embeddings often reflect updated context, and LLMs seem to weight freshness heavier than Google does\n\nI started refreshing our top content quarterly and it made a real difference. An okay article from 2 months ago can actually beat a better article from 2 years ago just on recency alone.\n\nFourth: author credentials. Not just \"By John Smith\" but like \"By John Smith, 12 years in B2B SaaS marketing, worked with 50+ companies\" … that specific.\n\nAdded proper author bios to 15 articles and citation rate went from like 28% to 43% over 4 weeks. LLMs cite credentialed authors way more for queries that mention expertise (like \"how do SEO experts approach X\" type questions).\n\nFifth: schema markup. But only the stuff that actually works:\n\n-HowTo schema - gets you cited like 1.7x more for instructional queries\n\n-FAQ schema - works well\n\n-Speakable schema - literally zero impact, don't waste your time\n\nReal example from last month:\n\nClient's onboarding guide before:\n\n-No stats at all\n\n-Super long paragraphs\n\n-18 months old\n\n-Author listed as \"Marketing Team\"\n\n-No schema\n\n-Result: 0/10 queries cited\n\nAfter fixes:\n\n-Added 7 relevant stats\n\n-Broke key points into standalone sentences\n\n-Refreshed everything to 2025\n\n-Added credentialed author with background\n\n-Implemented HowTo schema\n\n-Result: 7/10 queries cited\n\nTook me like 3 hours total to fix. Measured results over 4 weeks.\n\nOverall results across 200+ pages I've audited:\n\n-Before framework: 12% average citation rate\n\n-After framework: 47% average citation rate\n\n-Pages hitting all 5 criteria: 83% citation rate\n\n-Overall improvement: +292%\n\nwhich sounds made up but that's what the data showed lol\n\nTracking this stuff was honestly annoying. When I started doing this, literally no tools had good AI visibility features. So I was just manually searching 50 queries in ChatGPT every week and logging everything in a spreadsheet.\n\nEventually Semrush added their GEO tracking feature (part of AI Visibility toolkit) and it was the first major tool to actually do this properly.\n\nI still manually checked results for like the first month to make sure the data was reliable and honestly Semrush was both faster and more accurate than what I was seeing when I spot checked Ahrefs later. Saves me probably 5-6 hours a week now.\n\nBut yeah if you're just starting, validate this manually with your top 10-20 queries first. Proves the concept before spending money on tools.\n\nIf you wanna try this.. Pick your top 3 pages by traffic. Run through the 5 checks. Fix whatever's missing. Track it for a month and see.\n\n13% of Google queries already trigger AI Overviews now (was like 6% early last year). Gartner's out here predicting 50% organic traffic decline by 2028. So yeah this stuff isn't really optional anymore.\n\nLet me know what you find.",

I started my job, in the afternoon, I got on a call with the HR. She said to me if my “idle time” as shown by the software is more than 15%, then that’ll become an issue. \n\nThe software starts counting the idle time as soon as there is no movement by the keyboard or mouse for 10 seconds.\n\nNow, I had no idea about that. Asking people to work for 8 hours and then expect them to move their mouse or keyboard 85% of the time is a very bad criteria to judge somebody’s productivity. I felt drained at the end of the day. \n\nWorking 8 hours on site is very different from working 8 hours in a remote setup. On-site you can move around, take a break for 10-15 minutes and it will be fine. But in a remote setup, you are supposed to be looking at your screen for 8 hours straight.\n\nTechniques like the Pomodoro method help employees stay focused without burning out, but in most remote jobs, such strategies aren’t even considered, let alone implemented.\n\nProductivity should be a measure of the tasks accomplished and not how much you can move your mouse. Stop treating remote employees like some machines.\n\nFelt like ranting. Sorry for the long post.",

Additionally, I've been having this weird feeling lately that the work is beginning to feel meaningless.\n\nWeekly tasks include producing more content, chasing the algorithm, posting at \"optimal times,\" monitoring engagement rates that hardly change, and staying \"on trend\" while attempting to be genuine at the same time. I've seen results, and I'm good at it. However, I've also been feeling increasingly cut off from the reasons behind everything.\n\nIt’s hard to know what’s real anymore. Even the content that *works* often feels manufactured. And when I try to do something different, the numbers drop and stakeholders panic.\n\nI guess I’m just wondering… is anyone else in digital marketing feeling this? Like you’re doing all the right things, but it’s starting to feel repetitive, or like it’s missing heart? If you’ve found ways to bring meaning or energy back into this work, I’d love to hear how.\n\nThese days, it's difficult to tell what is real. Even effective content frequently comes across as fake. Additionally, stakeholders become alarmed and the numbers decline whenever I attempt to do something different.\n\nI suppose I'm just curious if anyone else in the field of digital marketing is experiencing this. Like you're doing everything correctly, but it's becoming monotonous, or like something's lacking? I'd be interested in knowing how you've managed to infuse this work with meaning or vitality.",
