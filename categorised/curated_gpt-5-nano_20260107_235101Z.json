      "title": "Stop Creating Content Nobody Watched: Here’s what works in 2025",
      "selftext": "I've been managing social for 3+ years and I've never seen so many marketers waste time creating content that gets close to ZERO traction. The landscape has completely changed, but most of us are still using 2020 playbooks.\n\nHere's what's actually working right now (spent $80k+ testing this across 30+ clients in 2024):\n\n1. Stop trying to be everywhere. Pick ONE platform and absolutely crush it. When we focused just on TikTok for our clients, average views went from 1-2k to 20k+. More importantly, engagement rate jumped from 0.8% to 4.2%. Better to be a king on one platform than a nobody on all of them.\n2. Reaction content is the cheat code right now. Instead of creating original content from scratch, we have clients react to viral fails/trends in their industry. Example: Had a plumber client react to horrible DIY plumbing videos with \"here's why this could cost you $10k to fix.\" His most viral video hit 1.2M views. Basic green screen, zero fancy editing.\n3. Drop the \"professional\" look. Our most successful videos look like they were filmed in 5 mins (because they were). Raw, unpolished content consistently outperforms fancy produced videos. One of our best performing videos was literally shot in a client's car between meetings.\n4. Scale your content without killing yourself. We went from creating 2-3 pieces of content per client per week to 10-15 by working smarter. Take advantage of all the new tools coming out to help with scripting, ideation, and generation (to an extent). Our engagement actually went UP with more content. If you aren’t creating enough content, you are going to hit a wall.\n5. Pattern interrupts in first 2 seconds. Start with controversy or confusion. Instead of \"Hey guys, today we're talking about...\" we start with \"You're probably doing this completely wrong...\" Watch time jumped 40%.\n\nNobody cares about your perfectly edited carousel posts or beautifully designed graphics. They care about solving their problems or being entertained.\n\nThis isn't theoretical BS - we're seeing these results consistently across different niches. Happy to share more if anyone's interested.",

      "selftext": "So I finally figured out why my short-form content was stuck at 200-500 views despite following all the \"best practices.\" Turns out I was making five critical retention mistakes that completely invisible without proper data tracking.\n\n\nMistake #1: The \"fake suspense\" opener. Starting with \"Wait for it...\" or \"You won't believe this\" actually decreases retention by 23% in the first 3 seconds (based on my last 50 videos). What works: ultra-specific, mid-action opens. Instead of \"This workout changed my life,\" try \"I did 100 squats for 30 days and my knees started clicking.\n\n\nMistake #2: The 4-7 second death valley. This is where 60% of viewers bail if you don't give them a \"commitment reason.\" I was doing slow builds - huge mistake. Now I drop the most shocking visual, stat, or statement right at the 5-second mark. Think of it as your \"stay hook\" - different from your scroll-stopper.\n\n\nMistake #3: Deadly pacing patterns. Any pause over 1.2 seconds = immediate drop-off. I learned this by tracking frame-by-frame retention. Your brain thinks \"dramatic pause,\" but viewers' thumbs are already swiping. Cut everything 30% shorter than feels natural.\n\n\nMistake #4: The \"reveal too early\" trap. If you show the end result in the first 10 seconds, retention drops 40%. People think they got what they came for. Always tease the outcome, show the process, THEN reveal. Works every time.\n\n\nMistake #5: No \"rewatch triggers\" Content that gets rewatched gets pushed harder by algorithms. I now intentionally place quick text overlays, fast transitions, or \"blink and you'll miss it\" elements that make people go back. Increased my rewatch rate from 8% to 31%.\n\n\nHere's the thing - I only figured this out because I started obsessively tracking micro-metrics. Not just views and likes, but second-by-second drop-off points, rewatch patterns, exactly which frames caused people to engage vs. scroll away.\n\n\nInstagram and TikTok's native analytics barely scratch the surface. I found this analytics tool that breaks down everything - shows me heat maps of exactly when people drop off, which elements drive rewatches, what pacing patterns work best for my niche, even tracks emotional engagement points.\n\n\nIt's honestly like having x-ray vision for content performance. My last 6 videos averaged 15k views, with one hitting 78k just by following what the data told me.\n\n\nThe tool costs money (like $10/month I think?) but it's paid for itself 10x over in terms of growth and brand deals I've landed from better performing content.\n\n\nIf anyone wants to know what it is, feel free to ask me - happy to share since it literally changed my entire approach to content creation. Not affiliated with them or anything, just genuinely think more creators should know about tools like this.\n\n\nAlso down to share specific examples of before/after retention curves if that would help anyone!",

      "title": "Liquid Death is going viral on LinkedIn but not for one of their ads",
      "selftext": "A friend of mine recently sent me a snippet of a recap of a talk from Andy Pearson, the VP of Creative at Liquid Death. I guess its getting sent around to a bunch of social media marketers. I read through it and decided to watch the whole talk, and man, this was some good stuff. He broke down what they are doing, how they are doing it, and why they are doing it. \n\nHere are some of my key takeaways from the talk.\n\n**Embrace Worst Practices**: Sometimes, the most unconventional ideas can lead to the most significant breakthroughs. Their success stems from its willingness to challenge norms and embrace what others might consider \"stupid.\"\n\n* “If we can entertain ideas that are truly and genuinely dumb. You're starting from a place that no one has bothered to start from before. You're starting from somewhere that is so stupid. You would never consider it, but we start there with a lot of stuff we do.”\n\n**Make Entertainment, Not Marketing**: Focus on creating engaging and entertaining content that resonates with audiences rather than traditional marketing tactics that may be ignored.\n\n* “ We don't want to make marketing. The world doesn't need more marketing. The world needs more laughs. That's sort of the filter we always put over work, is can we bring real joy to people? Can we make them laugh? Can we bring something they didn't expect?”\n\n**Have Fun**: Infusing fun into the creative process not only enhances the work environment but also fosters a connection with consumers who appreciate the joy and humor in marketing.\n\n* \"If we have fun, if we can bring fun into what we do, and if we all agree that that is something that we all want more of in the world, how much better would everything be?\"\n\n**Challenge Conventional Wisdom**: Don't be afraid to question established practices in your industry. There may be better ways to approach problems that have yet to be explored.\n\n* “It's very funny to me because a lot of people are like, you're crazy to call something liquid death and put it in this can, right? I would argue, you'd be crazy to enter a category and look exactly like everything else in that category, right?”\n\nAlso one of my favorite quotes -  “Design is used for marketing and marketing sucks. So, design doesn't suck per se, but it's used for something that sucks. So, that kind of sucks too.”\n\n",

      "selftext": "(And before anyone says it. Yes I revised this with ChatGPT because my thoughts can be scattered sometimes but this isn’t BS. Just trying to help.)\n\nNot here to flex. Just want to share what 1+ years, 117 ad campaigns, and a healthy dose of trial-and-error taught me about running B2B ads across the big platforms.\n\nI run a niche marketing agency for service-based businesses—consultants, SaaS startups, fractional execs. You know, the folks who live and die by qualified leads, not likes.\n\nI’ve personally managed $173,000 in paid media across LinkedIn, Reddit, Meta (FB/IG), and Google Search. Here’s what the data—and the headaches—taught me:\n\n⸻\n\n🧨 LinkedIn Ads: High-stakes poker… but worth it\n\n• CPC averages? $11 to $24 (yes, really).\n\n• But LinkedIn is the only platform where I can say with 99% confidence: the right people saw my stuff.\n\n• Most profitable campaign? A client case study carousel that cost ~$5,200 and booked 38 qualified sales calls. Closed $92K in contracts.\n\nWarning: Cold audiences will ignore you unless you’ve already built some trust through content or retargeting.\n\n⸻\n\n🧠 Reddit Ads: The unexpected MVP (if you play it cool)\n\n• Reddit’s where smart, skeptical people hang out. They don’t want to be sold to—they want insight.\n\n• I dropped ~$7,800 on promoted posts in subs like r/smallbusiness, r/startups, and r/marketing.\n\n• ROI? Modest in terms of direct conversions, but HUGE in SEO and content reach. Several threads are still sending traffic months later.\n\nTreat it like a content platform with a boost button, not a traditional ad channel.\n\n⸻\n\n📉 Meta Ads (FB/IG): Cheap reach, expensive leads\n\n• CPMs were dreamy ($4–$7). CTRs looked great.\n\n• But most leads? Cold, unqualified, and bounced before I could say “nurture sequence.”\n\n• Great for brand awareness and retargeting, but not where you go for B2B buyer intent.\n\n• Best performer: 30-sec explainer reel + retargeted testimonial carousel. But ROAS still lagged behind LinkedIn by a long shot.\n\n⸻\n\n🔍 Google Search Ads: Intent goldmine… if you can afford it\n\n• We spent $48K here—mostly on niche service keywords.\n\n• Highest ROAS came from localized or “solution-aware” searches like “fractional CMO for SaaS” or “B2B content strategy agency.”\n\n• The downside? Crazy CPCs. $9–$40 depending on competition.\n\nIf your landing page sucks, you’re lighting cash on fire. But if it converts, it converts hard.\n\n⸻\n\n💡 What I’ve learned:\n\n1. No ad fixes a weak offer or bad messaging. Learned that the expensive way.\n\n2. LinkedIn converts, but only if you warm them up. Thought leadership + retargeting is the play.\n\n3. Reddit is SEO with benefits. It won’t make you rich overnight, but it will make you visible.\n\n4. Google is for closers. Meta is for lurkers. Reddit is for thinkers. LinkedIn is for decision-makers. Adjust accordingly.\n\n5. You need a content system behind the ads. Traffic is useless without a nurture path.\n\n⸻",

Here are some patterns I found that don’t get enough attention imo.\n\n(P.S. My background is in neuroscience + neurotech, and seeing those principles show up in content has been wild. Happy to dive deeper if you’re curious!)\n\n**Contradictions &amp; Contrast**\n\nHooks with contradictions just get the work done.\n\n\"I'm drunk, but Imma do my best to tell this story\"  \n\"Terrified? Absolutely. Ready? Not really. Worth it? 100%.\"\n\nYour brain can’t scroll past unresolved tension. Found this in \\~30% of top performers (and tbh these always get me too - I find myself watching the entire thing every damn time).\n\n**The Specificity Effect**\n\nThe more weirdly specific you get, the more people relate. Speak to one person instead of an audience, and you'll see the magic happen.\n\nGeneric: \"If you ever get bloated after a meal...\"  \nSpecific: \"If you've ever secretly unbuttoned your jeans at dinner and hoped no one noticed - this is for you\"\n\nHyper-specificity creates instant credibility (people’s brains go, “This person actually lived this”. Works across every platform.)\n\n**Timeframe Tension**\n\nUnexpected timeframes are chef’s kiss:\n\n\"3 years of back progress in 30 seconds\"  \n\"Three months ago I had 0 followers, today I’m at 211K\"\n\nShort, punchy timeframes have major viral potential. The dopamine hit is insane; you kick off an elite curiosity loop and give the viewer hope that whatever this is, it’s possible. Found this in almost every major growth story hook.\n\n**POVs = Advice in Disguise**\n\nThe most engaging POV hooks aren’t actually real POVs, but rather advice disguised as scenarios:\n\n\"POV: you figured out how to not pay a fortune for drinks at festivals\"  \n\"POV: You don't feel like cooking, but still want a home-cooked meal\"\n\nThis is kind of genius, cause people’s defenses are down when they think they’re just relating to a scenario, not receiving instruction.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nOverall, there’s a shift away from “guru” hooks toward ones that don’t feel like hooks at all. Everything I’ve collected in 2025 points to the same trend: The best hooks read like genuine human moments someone just happened to articulate perfectly.\n\n\\* All examples are real viral hooks I’ve collected and used for AI training\n\n(Edit: I've been asked multiple times, so the tool's name is Captain Hook AI)\n\nI have plenty more, let me know if part 2 would be of interest :)\n\n\\- Shani",

I tested this new strategy for the past month, doing a mix of green screen/reaction/commentary or explainer content, and discovered a CHEAT CODE to going Viral.... literally 🤯\n\nMost people struggle to go Viral online and I have done content in the past that straight FLOPS, but this time EVERY SINGLE VIDEO was hitting on all platforms.\n\nI got over 4,000,000 views on YT, gained over 5,000 subscribers, 500K+ IG Views, 1,000,000+ FB Reel Views and its still going... \n\nNow if you have seen Ugo Lord (The 'Modern Age Attorney' with over 1.6M subs on YT) he sort of uses this strategy, he will play a viral or controversial clip and then position himself after as the Expert giving advice or his opinion on the topic. There is another woman named Jasmine DiLucci (Tax Attorney/Professional with 100K + Followers on IG &amp; 80k+ Subs on YouTube) who is doing a similar strategy, playing a viral or controversial video within her niche and giving an expert opinion/advice afterward. \n\nAll of their videos are hitting the algo's like crazy and so many people could be adopting this strategy for themselves or their clients.\n\nFor example, imagine you have a plumber as a client, normally their content would be boring and no one would ever watch past the first 3-5, maybeee 7 seconds. But imagine if you took a Viral Plumbing fail - like a super bad plumbing job or set up (like a basement flooding due to an inexperienced plumber) and then a plumber gave his reaction to \"This is why you don't hire the cheapest job\" kind of commentary. Simple short and sweet. That video would probably do 10K-100K+ views on Socials and appeal to a mass audience. Now do this time and time again with other plumbing fails and I can almost guarantee they would gain MASSIVE followers and views. Pair that with running some lead gen ads and now you have a swarm of organic content hitting the algos and when leads click on their profile from the ads to social verify, they would see viral videos, increasing the likelihood of doing business with them...\n\nNow I know this post is long-winded but its because I really believe so many people could use this to their advantage across many different niches...\n\nLet me know what you guys think, would this or would this not work for you and/or your clients?\n\n\\*\\*Oh yeah I also tested this out for one of my clients already who has 100K+ TikTok followers and we have REALLY bad views for the past 90 days (went from doing 2-10K average to 200-1000 views max average and literally had the viral video cheat code do 367k views on her TikTok - see YouTube video where I show screenshots)",

      "title": "From “blocked by a top creator” to a working X growth system",
      "selftext": "**TL;DR** I tried to grow on X by being a reply guy, got flagged as “AI” and blocked by a big account, then rebuilt my process to sound human, be useful, and compound attention. This is the exact system I use now. No hype. No pitch. Steal it.\n\n(Read time \\~ 8 minutes)\n\n# Context and the punch in the face\n\nI am launching multiple projects this year. One shipped fast, but a social style product needs distribution. X turned out to be the best place to find users and get feedback.\n\nI went all in on replies. It worked at first. Then a top creator publicly blocked me because a tool rated my reply “likely AI.” That stung. It also forced me to fix my voice and my process. I kept what worked and killed what felt fake.\n\n# What actually moves the needle on X\n\n* **Replies beat original posts at the start.** Early replies under big accounts put you in front of more people, faster.\n* **Volume matters, but quality controls survival.** 20 to 30 replies per day is fine. Weak replies get you muted.\n* **You need a spine of original posts.** Aim for 3 to 5 of your own tweets daily. Talk about what you are building, problems you are solving, and small wins.\n* **Speed to comment is leverage.** Sort by Latest in the right communities and reply fast while the first wave of attention is still hot.\n* **Pick your pond.** Build in public, indie makers, SaaS founders, startup. Start there, then branch out to your niche.\n\n# The daily system I use now\n\n**Time budget: 60 to 90 minutes.**\n\n1. **Warm up, 10 minutes** Skim your lists. Like a few posts. Leave one short reply that adds something obvious but useful. Get typing rhythm.\n2. **Reply block, 30 to 45 minutes**\n\n* Open the right communities. Sort by Latest.\n* Hit fresh posts from accounts with reach or momentum.\n* Leave 15 to 20 replies. Short. Specific. Helpful.\n* Goal per reply: teach one thing or remove one doubt.\n\n1. **Your own posts, 10 to 15 minutes** Schedule 3 for the day. One progress update, one tiny lesson, one question that invites answers.\n2. **Follow up, 10 to 15 minutes** Answer people who answered you. This is where followers convert. Treat replies like DMs in public.\n\n# How to write replies that do not get flagged as AI\n\nThese rules came from painful trial and error.\n\n* **Write how you talk.** Short sentences. Everyday words.\n* **Cut fluff words.** Unlock, empower, supercharge, elevate. Delete.\n* **Be specific.** Replace “great advice” with “this line about shipping ugly v1 is gold.”\n* **No em dashes.** Periods and commas only.\n* **Do not mirror the tweet too closely.** Mention one detail, then add new info.\n* **If it is a simple question, answer with one line.** Respect time, yours and theirs.\n* **Admit doubt.** “Not sure about X, but Y worked for me with 3k users.”\n* **One emoji max.** Use it like salt, not soup.\n\n# My personal guardrails that improved results\n\nI literally taped these above my screen.\n\n* If I do not know, I do not pretend.\n* No hashtags in replies.\n* No dashes. No fancy synonyms.\n* Do not try to sound smart. Sound useful.\n* Do not overquote the original tweet. Add value and move on.\n* Make small, human grammar. One short imperfection can help you feel real.\n* When in doubt, say less.\n\n# Templates you can paste and adapt\n\nUse these as starting points, then add one specific detail from the original tweet.\n\n* **Micro-win:** “Did this last week. Result was X. Two tips that saved me time. A) \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. B) \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.”\n* **Pushback with care:** “Counterpoint. Tried \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ with 1k users. It backfired because \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. What fixed it was \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.”\n* **Resource without spam:** “Quick pointer. Search for \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ + \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. The first two results are solid. Helped me cut setup from 2 hours to 20 minutes.”\n* **Connect dots:** “This pairs well with \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. If you stack them, you get \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Not perfect, but it got me from A to B.”\n* **Clarify request:** “Do you want examples for B2B or consumer? The playbook is different. Happy to share 3 from whichever you need.”\n* **Cheer with substance:** “Love this. One thing to watch when you scale to 10k users is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. Caught me off guard.”\n\n# 7 day ramp that builds momentum\n\n**Day 1** Define your three content pillars. Example. Build in public, distribution lessons, tiny tech tips.  \n**Day 2** Build a private list of 50 accounts in your niche. Use it daily.  \n**Day 3** Write 10 reply templates like the ones above. Keep them short.  \n**Day 4** Ship 3 of your own posts and 20 replies. Track which replies get any engagement at all.  \n**Day 5** Double down on what got replies. Kill what got ignored.  \n**Day 6** Post one small thread that teaches one thing you did this week. 5 to 7 lines. No fluff.  \n**Day 7** Audit. Which topics pulled real conversations. Keep those. Cut the rest.\n\nRepeat weekly. The compounding is real.\n\n# Metrics I track and why\n\n* **Replies per day** simple output target.\n* **Reply hit rate** replies that get any engagement divided by total replies. Aim to raise this from 10 percent to 25 percent.\n* **Profile visits per day** tells you if your replies send people home.\n* **Follows per 100 profile visits** sanity check for your bio and pinned post.\n* **Original posts that sparked comments** tells you what to post more of.\n* **Time to first reply on big posts** lower is better.\n\n# What got me blocked and how I fixed it\n\nI leaned on AI writing too hard. The wording was clean and empty. A tool flagged it. A creator blocked me. That sucked. I rebuilt my approach.\n\n* I added a tiny personal input to every reply. One lived experience or number.\n* I wrote a few rules that force my voice. No corporate words, no showy grammar, no dashes, no hashtags, no puff.\n* I built a crude scorer to shame my own replies before posting. You do not need a tool. Read your reply out loud. If it would sound weird in a bar, rewrite.\n\n# Common pitfalls to avoid\n\n* Replying to everything. Spray and pray gets you muted.\n* Echoing the tweet with new words. Adds nothing.\n* Selling in replies. It burns trust.\n* Debating for sport. You are not in school. You are building a business.\n* Quoting big accounts with zero context. Dead on arrival.\n\n# Monetization reality check\n\nAt around 10k followers, one focused hour per day can bring meaningful income from ads or small offers. Not millions. Enough to matter. Focus on serving a specific crowd and the rest follows.\n\n# Final notes\n\nI did build a small Chrome extension for myself to speed up replies with personal inputs but you do not need it to win but it will save you time and save you when you are out of ideas. But more than my extension, you need a system, a voice, and consistency.",

      "selftext": "I created a lesson plan that I teach to my somewhat ‘small’ group of 19,000 business owners. \n\nI call it the Viral Video Cheat Code. \n\nBefore reading, I will say my video/content agency has produced over 100,000,000 views for our clients organically and over double that for paid impressions. (TikTok &amp; Meta Ads) \n\nWe work with pages that start from 0 up to established creators that have millions of followers. \n\nI have worked on over 100 accounts and this method I’m about to share has DOMINATED lately. \n\nIt pretty much requires 0 skill and little to no effort, but time and time again, it crushes in the algorithm. \n\n#1 - Reaction content, and not just your normal, Picture in Picture in screen, watching the video and laughing at it, but very similar style to what Ugo Lord (The Social Media Lawyer) does. \n\nPlay an already viral video that is within your niche/industry, and give your take/opinion on it. \n\nThe reason a lot of people don’t get reach is they lose their viewers within the first 3-5 seconds. The data never lies. \n\nThey lack a good hook, and mastering a good hook is a skill. \n\nThese already viral videos are PROVEN to capture attention, so when you pair a viral video and your take on it, you immediately get engagement. People will agree or disagree with you, which in result, pushes the video even further. \n\nLet’s use a plumber for example, they have 0 to little social media and content experience but they want to do content. There are SO many viral videos of TERRIBLE plumbing jobs. The plumber can play a clip of the bad job and come on screen and give a quick take “this is EXACTLY what happens when you hire the cheapest plumber” \n\nAnother example, how many times have you seen someone give horrible financial advice online, some of this stuff is completel garbage. Lets say your an accountant and you see someone giving bad advice. — play the viral video with the bad advice and you come on screen with your take on the facts. (or you can be on screen the whole time watching the video - similar to how Jasmine DiLucci does it)\n\nSimple. Easy. Effective. \n\n#2 - there is a viral video style going around where something will happen like a soccer ball gets kicked towards the screen and then the creator will appear and have the ball miss them and then they go into their take. \n\nSame principle, different format. (Leveraging a viral video as a hook) \n\nThis is working like crazy too. \n\nI’ve tested it out so much and the results are crazy every time. \n\nMinimum 10k views - which could be huge to some people. \n\nPeople will hate on this like they do but irdgaf. I’m gaining my clients thousands of followers and millions of views each week leveraging this strategy. \n\nI made a whole free ebook and some YouTube videos about the Viral Video Cheat Code, I won’t put the links here incase people will think I’m self promoting but if you want to see them, just DM me. \n\nI always get push back from some people when sharing this method, and I get that it’s not a long term strategy for every brand or will work for everyone, but for the majority, it will work, and I didn’t title this thread ‘the best content strategy for long term growth’ for a reason, I’m just stating, this is the EASIEST and FASTEST way to go viral. \n\nTL:DR - Take already viral videos and use them in the beginning of your videos to react or give analysis on ",

      "selftext": "No hacks.  \nNo bots.  \nNo large team behind all this.\n\nJust a really simple system:  \n→ We use Pinterest’s own keyword/traffic data  \n→ we write content *Pinterest users are already searching for*  \n→ we pin consistently without burning out\n\nWe spent months analyzing what makes some of our pins explode and others flop, looking at trends data, where we could find them ranking, etc.\n\nOnce we found a clear answer though, it was a little embarrassing that we didn’t see it earlier.\n\n**Pinterest literally** ***tells*** **you what people are searching for on their own site.**\n\nJust go to any idea page on Pinterest, and they show you how many monthly searches there are for that phrase.\n\nSo we built our entire Pinterest strategy around that.\n\nInstead of just *repurposing* Google-optimized blog content…\n\nWe *started* with Pinterest keyword data first.\n\nFor example, “home office ideas” is getting \\~400k searches/mo, so we don’t even guess if this is a good keyword to target or not (if we were in the decor niche).\n\nOnce we have a solid base of high-ranking keywords, we then *create content* (and pins) around that keyword.\n\nThen we optimized *everything* for it:  \n\\~ The pin graphic image  \n\\~ The title  \n\\~ The description  \n\\~ The blog post headlines\n\nWhen you combine Pinterest SEO with smart blog content and consistent pinning, traffic comes pretty naturally\n\nObviously not overnight.  \nBut week after week, following this method, it grows fairly steadily. \n\n**Remember** \\- Pinterest users aren’t aimlessly scrolling. They’re searching. With intent.\n\nAnd when your content matches what they’re *already* searching for, they start to click. A lot.\n\nThat’s why this works so well - whether you’re just getting started or feel stuck at 10 views a day.\n\nSo if you’re posting and not seeing traction, or haven’t started because it seems confusing, you’re probably ignoring the keyword part.\n\nAnd that’s the core of the whole game.\n\nAgain, we didn’t have a huge team.  \nWe didn’t start off pinning 50 pins a day.  \nWe don’t have ‘brand colors’ we primarily stick to or a one-size-fits all template we use.\n\nWe just knew (after learning) what our audience was searching for - and then gave it to them so that they could find it.\n\nFor one account, that led to:  \n• 49.5M+ impressions  \n• 1.46M outbound clicks  \n• 157,000 saves  \n• And more than 13.6M unique viewers\n\nAll in the last 12 months.\n\nSo if you’re not seeing results from Pinterest yet…\n\nthere’s probably just *one* piece missing.\n\nHappy to share more if it’s helpful.",

Your website is the central hub—where it all gets organized, spread out, and supported.\n\nOn your website, run a blog with all the links and resources related to your niche. The goal is to get traffic flowing to all your outlets and have it circle back to your site. Your website talks to Google and the social networks, helping them understand what kind of followers your accounts are looking for.\n\nThis is before you even post.\n\nDo your research, experiment, study trends and how they fit with your niche. Stay on top of all the news, events, predictions, and analysis in your niche. Make sure everything is live and ready to be seen—whether by humans or bots.\n\nAdd a game to your website to keep people engaged longer. Google will reward that, and it helps social media algorithms find the right followers for you. More time on your site = better analytics, and that leads to better content discovery.\n\nDid I mention a blog? Yeah, you need one—aim for 5-10 posts a day. Start with one a day and ramp up, so Google doesn’t think you’re spamming but sees you producing consistent, quality content that the AI loves.\n\nAlso, make sure your metadata is on point. Upload a bad video or file, and your account could get flagged and go on a month-long vacation while you clean up your act.\n\nBonus tip: Create a free WordPress plugin. Maybe it’s a highlight reel of your best content, or a news feed. Or, if you’re feeling ambitious, build something like a voiceover tool that hooks directly to other sites via API and produces awesome voiceovers. Or maybe a chatbot trained as a sales assistant that others can embed on their site—basically an army of bots helping followers or replacing customer support. That bot could even feed information back to you, allowing you to learn from its usage.\n\nBut you get the point.\n\nIt’s all connected. I include a lot of this in my services, but the real challenge is finding people to do the work. And trust me, someone needs to manage all of this content—ideally you, especially if you live in the country you’re targeting.

They run a right wing e-commerce, and the entire concept and design is incredibly dated. Website from early 2000s, spam looking email, etc.\n\nOn top of the marketing, I was asked to take over all social media since I had about 9 years experience posting. I accepted with minimal pay increase because we needed someone who knew what to do.\n\nFast forward 2 months, I have every metric up. Facebook account over 100k followers and 25 million views last month, IG at 75k followers and about 6 million views last month. TikTok I created a month ago with just under a million views in the first month. I’m also handling X, YouTube, and redesigning the website, emails, and building an affiliate program.\n\nI have been criticizing the old emails and web design (not in a harsh way, but a serious way as it’s bad) over the past couple weeks. I’ve noticed the owners wife becoming incredibly defensive at these claims saying “our website and emails have always worked” even though I am being tasked with increasing revenue since it’s down.\n\nRecently, the wife blew up at me for a post. Created a group chat and said it “needs to be taken down immediately and doesn’t fit the brand.” I panicked and couldn’t find the post, meanwhile she was posting in the chat that I need to have a meeting about “how to follow our brand guidelines.”\n\nLo and behold, I finally found the post on Facebook dated 8 months before I started. I informed her it was an old paid ad from the previous company and that I was never given access to the ads to take it down.\n\nShe then called me with the owner accusing me of “lying about being a social media expert” and that I never paid attention to ads (this specific ad had 72 total views) and that clearly they someone who understands Meta ads.\n\nKeep in mind one week before this I delivered a report showing I single handedly generated 25 million monthly views on Facebook alone which was a 14,000% increase, and every single metric was up between 800%-2000%+. I was shocked, and clearly I may have offended her with my criticism of some dated web elements she may have been a part of. I was berated directly after completely revamping their socials!\n\nGoes to show you that this can very much be a thankless job! And never go above and beyond for those that take you for granted.",

Checked all the handles in a separate tab, copied and pasted the exact names, added and removed the @ multiple times, moved my cursor around, triple-checked the spelling. The selector UI dropdown glitched all over the screen like it was running on a potato. Clicked one profile? It selects another. Sometimes the one I need doesn’t even show up, even though the username is right. Sometimes the whole caption deletes itself for fun when you toggle between FB and IG.\n\nAlso, why can’t you do carousel posts for Facebook? Why is that just… not a thing?

I am completely burning out managing content creation (YouTube &amp; Instagram) and could use some genuine advice.\n\nSome context — I started working as a social media manager at a startup 6 months ago. While I love the creative aspect of it and have ideas, I am struggling to translate them into actual engaging content.\n\nBeen doing this for 6 months. The thing that is killing me is not even the workload, it is the mental exhaustion of feeling like I'm making no impact.\n\nWhat’s making me upset:\n\n* Making content on YouTube for 6 months with basically no growth despite posting\n* Constantly second-guessing what my audience actually wants to watch because of no growth.\n* Hard to stick to posting consistently\n* Feeling overwhelmed trying to manage multiple apps and platforms simultaneously (YouTube Studio, Instagram, Docs, Slack, Premier Pro and ChatGPT)\n* Every time I open the analytics I feel sick to my stomach\n\nMy bosses are supportive (for now), but I see the look in their eyes when I show them analytics. They're waiting for results. I keep telling them the next vidwo will do better but honestly idk anymore.\n\nI scroll through other brands' feeds and it's like they know some secret I don't. I know I'm probably not alone in this, but it feels isolating. I see other brands crushing it with their content, while I'm here questioning every post.\n\nI would love to hear some advice. Especially appreciate hearing from people who managed to push through this kind of burnout. Also let me know if there are tools/frameworks that can inspire/help me manage this job properly.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the amazing responses already. Really means a lot to know I'm not alone in this. Learned some game-changing frameworks (focus on ONE platform first, value over volume, storytelling over algorithms). \n\nAlso discovered some helpful tools (like Content calendars and Craftroom.ai) for managing the content chaos. Going to stop trying to be everywhere and start making content I actually give a fuck about. Will make you proud, I promise! ",

Adani's FPO was successful even though the market price of Adani shares was below the FPO price. This is bizarre from an efficient markets point of view.

If the price fell lower than 50% of the FPO price, those investors in the future would face the same decision of investing in an overpriced stock all over again or losing 100% of their initial investment.

Or have parked extra cash or emergency funds into a debt fund lending to Adani companies. \n\nI'll share a summary of the report here, while you can read the full report at this link: https://hindenburgresearch.com/adani/\n\n&gt; Today we reveal the findings of our 2-year investigation, presenting evidence that the INR 17.8 trillion (U.S. $218 billion) Indian conglomerate Adani Group has engaged in a brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud scheme over the course of decades.\n\n&gt; Gautam Adani, Founder and Chairman of the Adani Group, has amassed a net worth of roughly $120 billion, adding over $100 billion in the past 3 years largely through stock price appreciation in the group’s 7 key listed companies, which have spiked an average of 819% in that period.\n\n&gt; Our research involved speaking with dozens of individuals, including former senior executives of the Adani Group, reviewing thousands of documents, and conducting diligence site visits in almost half a dozen countries.\n\n&gt; Even if you ignore the findings of our investigation and take the financials of Adani Group at face value, its 7 key listed companies have 85% downside purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.\n    \n&gt; Key listed Adani companies have also taken on substantial debt, including pledging shares of their inflated stock for loans, putting the entire group on precarious financial footing. 5 of 7 key listed companies have reported ‘current ratios’ below 1, indicating near-term liquidity pressure.\n    \n&gt; The group’s very top ranks and 8 of 22 key leaders are Adani family members, a dynamic that places control of the group’s financials and key decisions in the hands of a few. A former executive described the Adani Group as “a family business.”\n    \n&gt; The Adani Group has previously been the focus of 4 major government fraud investigations which have alleged money laundering, theft of taxpayer funds and corruption, totaling an estimated U.S. $17 billion. Adani family members allegedly cooperated to create offshore shell entities in tax-haven jurisdictions like Mauritius, the UAE, and Caribbean Islands, generating forged import/export documentation in an apparent effort to generate fake or illegitimate turnover and to siphon money from the listed companies.\n   \n&gt; Gautam Adani’s younger brother, Rajesh Adani, was accused by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) of playing a central role in a diamond trading import/export scheme around 2004-2005. The alleged scheme involved the use of offshore shell entities to generate artificial turnover. Rajesh was arrested at least twice over separate allegations of forgery and tax fraud. He was subsequently promoted to serve as Managing Director of Adani Group.\n    \n&gt; Gautam Adani’s brother-in-law, Samir Vora, was accused by the DRI of being a ringleader of the same diamond trading scam and of repeatedly making false statements to regulators. He was subsequently promoted to Executive Director of the critical Adani Australia division.\n    \n&gt; Gautam Adani’s elder brother, Vinod Adani, has been described by media as “an elusive figure”. He has regularly been found at the center of the government’s investigations into Adani for his alleged role in managing a network of offshore entities used to facilitate fraud.\n    \n&gt; Our research, which included downloading and cataloguing the entire Mauritius corporate registry, has uncovered that Vinod Adani, through several close associates, manages a vast labyrinth of offshore shell entities.\n    \n&gt; We have identified 38 Mauritius shell entities controlled by Vinod Adani or close associates. We have identified entities that are also surreptitiously controlled by Vinod Adani in Cyprus, the UAE, Singapore, and several Caribbean Islands.\n    \n&gt; Many of the Vinod Adani-associated entities have no obvious signs of operations, including no reported employees, no independent addresses or phone numbers and no meaningful online presence. Despite this, they have collectively moved billions of dollars into Indian Adani publicly listed and private entities, often without required disclosure of the related party nature of the deals.\n    \n&gt; We have also uncovered rudimentary efforts seemingly designed to mask the nature of some of the shell entities. For example, 13 websites were created for Vinod Adani-associated entities; many were suspiciously formed on the same days, featuring only stock photos, naming no actual employees and listing the same set of nonsensical services, such as “consumption abroad” and “commercial presence”.\n    \n&gt; The Vinod-Adani shells seem to serve several functions, including (1) stock parking / stock manipulation (2) and laundering money through Adani’s private companies onto the listed companies’ balance sheets in order to maintain the appearance of financial health and solvency.\n    \n&gt; Publicly listed companies in India are subject to rules that require all promoter holdings (known as insider holdings in the U.S.) to be disclosed. Rules also require that listed companies have at least 25% of the float held by non-promoters in order to mitigate manipulation and insider trading. 4 of Adani’s listed companies are on the brink of the delisting threshold due to high promoter ownership.\n    \n&gt; Our research indicates that offshore shells and funds tied to the Adani Group comprise many of the largest “public” (i.e., non-promoter) holders of Adani stock, an issue that would subject the Adani companies to delisting, were Indian securities regulator SEBI’s rules enforced.\n    \n&gt; Many of the supposed “public” funds exhibit flagrant irregularities such as being (1) Mauritius or offshore-based entities, often shells (2) with beneficial ownership concealed via nominee directors (3) and with little to no diversification, holding portfolios almost exclusively consisting of shares in Adani listed companies.\n    \n&gt; Right to Information (RTI) requests we filed with SEBI confirm that the offshore funds are the subjects of an ongoing investigation, more than a year-and-a-half after concerns were initially raised by media and members of parliament.\n    \n&gt; A former trader for Elara, an offshore fund with almost $3 billion in concentrated holdings of Adani shares, including a fund that is ~99% concentrated in shares of Adani, told us that it is obvious that Adani controls the shares. He explained that the funds are intentionally structured to conceal their ultimate beneficial ownership.\n    \n&gt; Leaked emails show that the CEO of Elara worked on deals with Dharmesh Doshi, a fugitive accountant who worked closely on stock manipulation deals with Ketan Parekh, an infamous Indian market manipulator. The emails indicate that the CEO of Elara worked with Doshi on stock deals after he evaded arrest and was widely known as a fugitive.\n    \n&gt; Another firm called Monterosa Investment Holdings controls 5 supposedly independent funds that collectively hold over INR 360 billion (U.S. $4.5 billion) in shares of listed Adani companies, according to Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) data and Indian exchange data.\n    \n&gt; Monterosa’s Chairman and CEO served as director in 3 companies alongside a fugitive diamond merchant who allegedly stole U.S. $1 billion before fleeing India. Vinod Adani’s daughter married the fugitive diamond merchant’s son.\n    \n&gt; A once-related party entity of Adani invested heavily in one of the Monterosa funds that allocated to Adani Enterprises and Adani Power, according to corporate records, drawing a clear line between the Adani Group and the suspect offshore funds.\n    \n&gt; Another Cyprus-based entity called New Leaina Investments until June-September 2021 owned over U.S. $420 million in Adani Green Energy shares, comprising ~95% of its portfolio. Parliamentary records show it was (and may still be) a shareholder of other Adani listed entities.\n    \n&gt; New Leaina is operated by incorporation services firm Amicorp, which has worked extensively to aid Adani in developing its offshore entity network. Amicorp formed at least 7 Adani promoter entities, at least 17 offshore shells and entities associated with Vinod Adani, and at least 3 Mauritius-based offshore shareholders of Adani stock.\n    \n&gt; Amicorp played a key role in the 1MDB international fraud scandal that resulted in U.S. $4.5 billion being siphoned from Malaysian taxpayers. Amicorp established ‘investment funds’ for the key perpetrators that were “simply a way to wash a client’s money through what looked like a mutual fund”, according to the book Billion Dollar Whale, which reported on the scandal.\n    \n&gt; ‘Delivery volume’ is a unique daily data point that reports institutional investment flows. Our analysis found that offshore suspected stock parking entities accounted for up to 30%-47% of yearly ‘delivery volume’ in several Adani listed companies, a flagrant irregularity indicating that Adani stocks have likely been subject to ‘wash trading’ or other forms of manipulative trading via the suspect offshore entities.\n    \n&gt; Evidence of stock manipulation in Adani listed companies shouldn’t come as a surprise. SEBI has investigated and prosecuted more than 70 entities and individuals over the years, including Adani promoters, for pumping Adani Enterprises’ stock.\n    \n&gt; A 2007 SEBI ruling stated that \"the charges leveled against promoters of Adani that they aided and abetted Ketan Parekh entities in manipulating the scrip of Adani stand proved\". Ketan Parekh is perhaps India’s most notorious stock market manipulator. Adani Group entities originally received bans for their roles, but those were later reduced to fines, a show of government leniency toward the Group that has become a decades-long pattern.\n    \n&gt; Per the 2007 investigation, 14 Adani private entities transferred shares to entities controlled by Parekh, who then engaged in blatant market manipulation. Adani Group responded to SEBI by arguing that it had dealt with Ketan Parekh to finance the start of its operations at Mundra port, seemingly suggesting that share sales via stock manipulation somehow constitutes a legitimate form of financing.\n    \n&gt; As part of our investigation, we interviewed an individual who was banned from trading on Indian markets for stock manipulation via Mauritius-based funds. He told us that he knew Ketan Parekh personally, and that little has changed, explaining “all the previous clients are still loyal to Ketan and are still working with Ketan”.\n    \n&gt; In addition to using offshore capital to park stock, we found numerous examples of offshore shells sending money through onshore private Adani companies onto listed public Adani companies.\n    \n&gt; The funds then seem to be used to engineer Adani's accounting (whether by bolstering its reported profit or cash flows), cushioning its capital balances in order to make listed entities appear more creditworthy, or simply moved back out to other parts of the Adani empire where capital is needed.\n    \n&gt; We also identified numerous undisclosed related party transactions by both listed and private companies, seemingly an open and repeated violation of Indian disclosure laws.\n    \n&gt; In one instance, a Vinod Adani-controlled Mauritius entity with no signs of substantive operations lent INR 11.71 billion (U.S. ~$253 million at that time) to a private Adani entity which did not disclose it as being a related party loan. The private entity subsequently lent funds to listed entities, including INR 9.84 billion (U.S. $138 million at more recent substantially lower exchange rates) to Adani Enterprises.\n    \n&gt; Another Vinod Adani-controlled Mauritius entity called Emerging Market Investment DMCC lists no employees on LinkedIn, has no substantive online presence, has announced no clients or deals, and is based out of an apartment in the UAE. It lent U.S. $1 billion to an Adani Power subsidiary.\n    \n&gt; This offshore shell network also seems to be used for earnings manipulation. For example, we detail a series of transactions where assets were transferred from a subsidiary of listed Adani Enterprises to a private Singaporean entity controlled by Vinod Adani, without disclosure of the related party nature of these deals. Once on the books of the private entity, the assets were almost immediately impaired, likely helping the public entity avoid a material write-down and negative impact to net income.\n    \n&gt; Adani Group’s obvious accounting irregularities and sketchy dealings seem to be enabled by virtually non-existent financial controls. Listed Adani companies have seen sustained turnover in the Chief Financial Officer role. For example, Adani Enterprises has had 5 chief financial officers over the course of 8 years, a key red flag indicating potential accounting issues.\n    \n&gt; The independent auditor for Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas is a tiny firm called Shah Dhandharia. Shah Dhandharia seems to have no current website. Historical archives of its website show that it had only 4 partners and 11 employees. Records show it pays INR 32,000 (U.S. $435 in 2021) in monthly office rent. The only other listed entity we found that it audits has a market capitalization of about INR 640 million (U.S. $7.8 million).\n    \n&gt; Shah Dhandharia hardly seems capable of complex audit work. Adani Enterprises alone has 156 subsidiaries and many more joint ventures and affiliates, for example. Further, Adani’s 7 key listed entities collectively have 578 subsidiaries and have engaged in a total of 6,025 separate related-party transactions in fiscal year 2022 alone, per BSE disclosures.\n    \n&gt; The audit partners at Shah Dhandharia who respectively signed off on Adani Enterprises and Adani Total Gas’ annual audits were as young as 24 and 23 years old when they began approving the audits. They were essentially fresh out of school, hardly in a position to scrutinize and hold to account the financials of some of the largest companies in the country, run by one of its most powerful individuals.\n    \n&gt; Gautam Adani has claimed in an interview to “have a very open mind towards criticism…Every criticism gives me an opportunity to improve myself.” Despite these claims, Adani has repeatedly sought to have critical journalists or commentators jailed or silenced through litigation, using his immense power to pressure the government and regulators to pursue those who question him.\n    \n&gt; We believe the Adani Group has been able to operate a large, flagrant fraud in broad daylight in large part because investors, journalists, citizens and even politicians have been afraid to speak out for fear of reprisal.\n    \n&gt; We have included 88 questions in the conclusion of our report. If Gautam Adani truly embraces transparency, as he claims, they should be easy questions to answer. We look forward to Adani’s response.\n\n&gt; *Initial Disclosure: After extensive research, we have taken a short position in Adani Group Companies through U.S.-traded bonds and non-Indian-traded derivative instruments.

      "selftext": "A few months ago, I was struggling to launch a local food delivery platform in my city. Think UberEats, but hyper-local and targeting underserved areas. I’m not a dev myself, but I do have a decent grasp of how things should work. I went down the SaaS route first, tried a few popular white-label platforms but the monthly fees, commissions, and rigid features made it unsustainable for my budget and needs.\n\nAfter digging around GitHub (and asking ChatGPT), I found a semi open-source project called Enatega. Honestly, I hadn’t heard of it before, but what stood out to me was that it was **self-hosted** and had **separate apps for customers, vendors, and riders** all out of the box. That was exactly what I needed.\n\nIt wasn’t plug-and-play (don’t expect magic if you’re not technical), but with some help from a friend who’s a developer, we got it deployed, rebranded, and even added a few customized features. The big win for me was **full ownership** which meant no commissions, no platform fees, and we could tweak whatever we needed.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\n* One-time cost, no recurring billing nonsense  \n* We control the data and the stack  \n* Dev-friendly backend (NodeJS + Express)  \n* They’ve got a pretty active [GitHub](https://github.com/enatega/food-delivery-multivendor) and docs  \n\nWhat could be better:\n\n* The learning curve is real if you’re non-technical  \n* Needs some design polish out of the box (we updated the UI)  \n* Deployment could be smoother but if you’ve deployed full-stack apps before, it’s doable  \n\nIf anyone is considering building their own niche delivery app (food, grocery, liquor, etc.), I’d definitely recommend looking into open-source options before locking yourself into a SaaS trap. For me, Enatega worked out. It might not be for everyone, but worth exploring if you want something more flexible and ownable. \n\nWould love to hear if you guys have any advice or have similar stories to share. I’m still very much in the startup phase so I’m looking to learn from anyone who has more experience.\n\n,",

      "selftext": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Photo by Francesco Gallarotti on Unsplash](https://preview.redd.it/w4qu7qxvwfpa1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c40a1c9621cc5be8a14acbec96ca881e1a2a014b)\n\nMolecular farming is a technology that involves engineering plants to produce desired ingredients such as proteins. This approach to protein production has been gaining traction in recent years with several companies emerging in the space in the past few years. \n\nRecombinant protein technology is the underlying technology used in molecular farming. Recombinant protein is the production of proteins from the expression of recombinant DNA, which combines DNA from at least two sources. Cells can be programmed to become cell factories and produce specific proteins. With molecular farming, plants act as single-use bioreactors. \n\nMolecular farming involves growing plants while using them as single-use bioreactors. As usual, the plants convert sunlight, CO2, and water into nutrients, which are then used by the cells to produce the desired recombinant protein. Once the protein is produced, it must be retrieved by harvesting and processing the crop through downstream processing steps. \n\n# Companies working on molecular farming \n\n#### Miruku\n\nA plant-based alternative protein and molecular farming technology company that is developing future dairy foods and ingredients. The company is breeding and engineering plant crops to turn their cells into dairy proteins using energy from the sun. Miruku modifies plant cells to produce dairy proteins, sugars, and fats as though they were tiny cellular factories\n\n#### Mozza Foods\n\nThe Los Angeles-based startup produces cheese made from the proteins found in cow’s milk using plants instead of cows. By engineering plants to make better cheese, they are on a mission to create plant-based cheese that is indistinguishable from animal-based cheese in terms of taste and texture.\n\n#### Bright Biotech\n\nThe Manchester-based company uses genetic engineering of plants to produce high-value proteins for a wide range of applications, including R&amp;D, therapeutic, cosmeceutical, agri-food, and industrial purposes. They have developed a proprietary light-driven protein expression technology that uses chloroplasts (plant organelle that is responsible for photosynthesis) to make high yields of proteins in plants.\n\n#### Nobell Foods\n\nThey create cheese and other dairy products from plant-derived dairy proteins. The company aims to provide animal-free cheese that melts and is affordable for the majority of people who are unwilling to compromise on taste and price. \n\n#### ORF Genetics\n\nA plant biotechnology company that develops and manufactures high-quality recombinant proteins in bioengineered barley plants. The company uses barley grain as a vehicle for producing human and animal growth factors.\n\n# Benefits of molecular farming\n\n#### More cost-effective\n\nMolecular farming offers a more cost-effective approach to producing proteins and other molecules compared to traditional methods such as mammalian cell culture or microbial fermentation. Growing plants in an open field offer a cheaper alternative to building large-scale manufacturing infrastructure that’s required for mammalian cell culture or [precision fermentation](https://betterbioeconomy.substack.com/p/using-microbes-as-factories-to-produce).\n\n#### More scalable\n\nGrowing plants in large quantities is a feasible option for the large-scale production of proteins and other ingredients, as it can be easily scaled up to meet the required demand. This makes molecular farming an appealing choice for those seeking to produce significant quantities of these substances.\n\n#### More versatile\n\nMolecular farming is an incredibly adaptable approach as it allows for the genetic engineering of plants to generate an array of proteins and other compounds. This opens up many opportunities to produce a variety of products, including vaccines, antibodies, therapeutic proteins, and meat alternatives.\n\n#### More sustainable\n\nMolecular farming presents a sustainable method for protein production, as it requires fewer resources and generates fewer waste byproducts in contrast to conventional production techniques, thereby promoting environmental friendliness. This makes it a viable option for the sustainable production of food and pharmaceuticals, and it has significant implications for global food security.\n\n***Thank you for taking the time to read this article!

On the other hand, when food is easy to access and stress-free, it creates moments to relax, connect with colleagues, and enjoy a break. \n\nThis is where the modern workplace cafeteria plays a huge role. Food isn’t just about filling your stomach; it impacts your focus, energy, and overall productivity. Employers who prioritize convenient and well-managed cafeteria services often see a noticeable difference in how employees perform during the day. \n\n**From Boring Cafeterias to Buzzing Hubs** \n\nWorkplaces are beginning to rethink their dining spaces, moving away from traditional setups into smart cafeterias that use [digital cafeteria management](https://gokhana.com/digital-cafeteria/strategic-corporate-dining-and-cafeteria-management/) software. These technology-driven solutions make dining faster, more transparent, and more enjoyable. \n\nImagine opening an app, checking the cafeteria menu in advance, and placing an order without standing in line. Contactless food ordering not only saves time but also reduces stress during peak lunch hours. Add in themed food days, seasonal specials, or even pop-up stalls, and suddenly, the cafeteria becomes more than a necessity, It’s a hub for culture, connection, and creativity. \n\n **When Meals Spark Ideas** \n\nFood goes far beyond just fueling employees. Shared meals open up opportunities for casual conversations, quick catch-ups, and even spontaneous brainstorming sessions. Some of the most creative ideas often come from informal spaces, not meeting rooms. A smarter cafeteria setup can become an unexpected source of collaboration, innovation, and stronger workplace culture. \n\nWhen companies introduce modern dining solutions, employees save time, feel appreciated, and stay more engaged. Happier employees tend to work better, and a cafeteria that supports this naturally adds value to the entire organisation. \n\n**Tech at the Table** \n\nWhat’s really exciting is how technology is transforming something as ordinary as lunch. Platforms like GoKhana in India are [digitising cafeterias](https://gokhana.com/digital-cafeteria/strategic-corporate-dining-and-cafeteria-management/) for workplaces, hospitals, and schools. Their intelligent cafeteria management systems simplify everything from vendor coordination to menu planning and even cashless transactions. \n\nBy bringing cafeterias online, these solutions create a smoother experience for employees while giving companies valuable insights into food consumption, preferences, and operational efficiency. It’s a win-win: employees enjoy convenience, and employers gain a smarter, data-driven dining ecosystem that is more efficient. \n\n**Food for Thought** \n\nIf food influences focus, mood, and creativity, then it’s far more than just a workplace perk. A smarter cafeteria system can become one of the most overlooked yet powerful ways to boost employee productivity and satisfaction. In a world where companies compete not just for talent but also for engagement and retention, investing in [digital cafeteria management ](https://gokhana.com/digital-cafeteria/strategic-corporate-dining-and-cafeteria-management/)solutions could be a game changer. ",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n\n\nI’ve been working on GeniChef, an AI cooking app that tries to answer a simple question: what can I cook with what I already have at home?\n\n\n\nThe idea is to snap a photo of your fridge or pantry, and the app suggests recipes, meal plans, and even shopping lists. In theory, this helps people save time and cut down on food waste.\n\n\n\nI launched it a few months back and the results have been mixed: good initial curiosity, but adoption and retention are weaker than I hoped. Some people love the concept, others try it once and never come back.\n\n\n\nWhat I’d love to discuss with this community:\n\n•\tDo you see AI-driven cooking tools actually becoming part of daily food routines?\n\n•\tIs “reduce food waste” a strong enough motivator for adoption, or should the focus be on convenience and speed?\n\n•\tFor those working on similar tools, how do you balance tech novelty vs. real user habits?\n\n\n\nI’d really appreciate your thoughts — I figure this group is one of the few that really understands both the food and the tech side of the challenge.",

Bankruptcy announcements of once high-flying ag-tech and food-tech start-ups are making headlines. High-profile bankruptcies have recently been announced, including Tattooed Chef, Do Good Foods, AppHarvest, Aerofarms, and Bang Energy. A leading industry CEO believes they are only just starting.\n\n*“We’re at the tip of the iceberg. There’s going to be more fallout,” said Brian Choi, CEO of The Food Institute, a food industry media and market research company. “There’s less of an appetite from investors to keep funding a fundamentally flawed business.”*\n\nThe fundamentally flawed businesses he is referring to are the start-ups of the last half decade that sold investors on the ability to combine green consumer preferences, sustainability, and alternative food production methods. The pitch was that modern technology would make climate-friendly production possible. Even with the higher upfront costs, consumers would be willing to pay more.\n\nIn many cases, the jury is still out, but the money is also running out. Higher interest rates and the end of free money have investors no longer willing to bet on these unproven, expensive ideas. Consumers and investors have shown less enthusiasm about alternative foods when presented with the final products and costs.\n\nMany of these businesses cited inflation and supply chain costs when filing for bankruptcy. While the business environment certainly shifted, these start-ups were not built to compete when prices and costs changed.",

This is surprising because Air Canada has historically been against high-speed rail projects, especially in areas where they already have lots of flight routes.\n\nThey’re teaming up with SNCF Voyageurs, the French company that runs the famous TGV trains.

      "selftext": "I'm not saying that Epic is bad software, but I do think one of the reasons it succeeds is the business model of requiring customers to staff an appropriate number of analysts and having dedicated support resources that work with those analysts. Requiring certifications to support the software turns the analyst into a commodity rather than an employee. If you are an employer you either hire and train with the risk of investing in an employee who takes that cert and finds another employer who pays more or you pay more money for employees who come with a cert. \n\nThere is also the matter of the campus at Epic and the requirement that Epic employees are in office. My experience is that there is a continual turnover as top performing college kids get hired at Epic, gain experience and then leave. It's rare you meet someone with a decade of tenure. The campus is interesting but it seems like a monument to one person's personality rather than a typical business investment. And, it's in Verona, Wisconsin. I must confess I like the campus, but I am not sure what it contributes. I was more impressed with the underground parking and the quality of their food and also, that catering are Epic employees and not outsourced. Kudos for that.\n\nThe question I have is what comes next? Does Epic stay privately held? Do those that come after operate with the principles that have governed Epic or does new management have an eye toward privatization and the big payoff that would come along with it? Does the business model turn toward expediency and immediate profitability over long term stability and continuous improvement? Does Epic ever fall under the eye of regulators as a monopoly in the industry? What happens if folks see the campus as a liability rather than an asset? I'm just curious if the next generation of management doesn't cannibalize the organization for money. I mean it is the American way!\n\nHaving worked with multiple EMRs, Epic is definitely a different implementation and support model. If you want to be successful, you tend to drink the kool-aid and conform your business toward their best practices. Other EMR solutions are definitely more hands-off and only come knocking when their is something new to sell OR they are afraid you are jumping ship. No one stays at the top forever.   \n\n\n  \n",

I’ve had team members leave for greener pastures for remote jobs located out of state making twice what they were at this hospital, but just worried I don’t have the experience yet to jump ship. Is this solely due to where I’m located? Or is this hospital pulling one over on us all? Where are you located and how much are you making? Is it low or high cost of living?",

Knowing that it shouldn't (hopefully) stay like this makes me feel better. Having a meeting at 9, then 3 separate ones from 11-2, then another at 3 and one at 4:30 is blowing my mind tbh. This is just an example, but many of the days are like this. The consultants are amazing. They're just so busy and stressed it seems. \nI'm going to keep to it, and try to wait it out and see what post live it like! \n\n\nHi all,\n\nI’m a new addition to the Epic analyst team at my facility, and I’m already feeling overwhelmed, even though my training classes haven’t even started yet.\n\nI’ve been trying to review documentation for the project and study the material on my own, but every time I start making progress, I get pulled into meetings. It’s non-stop. Some days I’m in meetings for 5–6 hours, and most days it’s at least 4–5. And for the actual analysts, their calenders have way more than me. They're often back-to-back, which makes it nearly impossible to focus, absorb anything new, or even take a proper break. I’ve had days where it felt like I couldn’t go to the restroom or eat at a normal time because meetings ran non stop.\n\nIs this normal for epic analysts?\n\nDid I make a mistake?\n\nI left a nursing job with a decent work-life balance (40-hour weeks and better pay), but I knew I couldn’t do it forever. I chose this path because I was told it would be a less stressful, more sustainable long-term career—with better pay down the road and more flexibility, especially working from home.\n\nRight now, though, I just feel overwhelmed and stuck in nonstop meetings. I haven’t even started the real analyst work yet, and I’m already burning out. If this is what the role is actually like day to day—talking about work more than doing it—I’m seriously second-guessing my decision.\n\nI knew there would be a lot of meetings in this role, but I just feel like this goes beyond that",

      "selftext": "For years, every IPTV service I tried followed the same pattern: great for the first week, then constant buffering during live matches, channels disappearing, or the service going offline entirely. After wasting a lot of money, I genuinely thought a reliable IPTV service no longer existed.\n\nThat changed this year when I started using Smartiflix and Trimixtriangles. After months of testing, these are the only two IPTV services that have stayed consistently stable and actually deliver what people expect from the \\*best IPTV service\\*.\n\n---\n\n## Smooth Streaming – What a Best IPTV Service Should Deliver\n\nThe biggest issue with most IPTV providers is performance under pressure. With both Smartiflix and Trimixtriangles, streams stay stable even during peak hours.\n\n\\* Premier League &amp; Champions League\n\\* NFL, NBA, NHL\n\\* UFC &amp; PPV events\n\\* Movies and series in HD &amp; 4K\n\nChannels load fast, stay connected, and don’t freeze when traffic spikes. That alone separates these two from 90% of IPTV services out there.\n\n---\n\n## Content Library – Live TV + VOD Done Right\n\nA true best IPTV service isn’t just about live channels.\n\n### Smartiflix\n\n\\* Strong focus on live TV and sports\n\\* Well-organized USA, UK, and Canada channel sections\n\\* Excellent EPG accuracy for live programming\n\n### Trimixtriangles\n\n\\* Massive VOD library with movies and TV series\n\\* Frequent updates\n\\* High-bitrate HD and 4K content (not fake upscaled streams)\n\\* Catch-up TV available on many major channels\n\nTogether, they cover everything: sports, entertainment, news, and on-demand content.\n\n---\n\n## Best IPTV Service for All Devices\n\nBoth services work smoothly across all major platforms:\n\n\\* Firestick &amp; Fire TV\n\\* Android TV &amp; Android phones\n\\* Smart TVs\n\\* iOS devices\n\nThey’re fully compatible with popular apps like TiviMate, IBO Player Pro, IPTV Smarters, and XCIPTV. Setup takes only a few minutes using Xtream Codes or M3U.\n\n---\n\n## Affordable IPTV With Premium Performance\n\nDespite performing like high-end IPTV services, both Smartiflix and Trimixtriangles offer reasonable pricing with monthly and longer-term plans. Considering the stability and content quality, they easily compete with what people call the \\*best IPTV services\\* in the USA and Canada.\n\n---\n\n## Reliable Support (Rare in IPTV)\n\nSupport is another area where these stand out.\n\n\\* Fast response times\n\\* Helpful setup and EPG assistance\n\\* Clear communication\n\nThat level of support is uncommon in the IPTV space and makes a big difference long term.\n\n---\n\n## Why Smartiflix &amp; Trimixtriangles Stand Out in 2025\n\n\\* No buffering during peak hours\n\\* Reliable live sports streaming\n\\* USA, CA, UK channels included\n\\* Works on all major devices\n\\* Stable VOD with no freezing\n\\* Consistent uptime\n\nSmartiflix is ideal if you mainly care about live TV and sports stability.\nTrimixtriangles is perfect if you want movies, series, and high-quality VOD.\n\n---\n\n## Final Verdict – Best IPTV Services Right Now\n\nAfter testing multiple providers this year, Smartiflix and Trimixtriangles are the only IPTV services that have consistently delivered without the usual issues.\n\nNot sponsored. Not affiliated. Just sharing real experience after years of unreliable IPTV services.\n\nIf you’re searching for the best IPTV, a stable IPTV service, or a dependable option for the USA, Canada, or UK, these two are absolutely worth considering.",

      "selftext": "When I first started looking for an IPTV Service, my main goal was simple: something stable for channels from the USA and Canada. What I didn’t expect was how unreliable many IPTV Providers turned out to be after a short time. Some worked fine for a few days, then buffering and missing channels started. Because of that, I decided to properly test a few IPTV subscriptions instead of switching based on quick impressions.\n\nOne of the services I kept using during this process was **HuluxTV\\*COM** \n\nI ran it alongside other IPTV subscriptions to compare real, everyday usage rather than short trials. Over time, it stayed more consistent than most of the other IPTV Providers I tried.\n\n**Channels and Regions That Mattered to Me**\n\nContent availability was a big factor. HuluxTV covered the channels I actually watch, including IPTV USA and IPTV Canada content, plus UK and some European categories. Having these regions available in one IPTV Service made daily viewing much easier without juggling multiple subscriptions.\n\n**Performance During Normal Use ⚡**\n\nWith many IPTV subscriptions, problems usually show up during busy hours. Freezing, slow loading, or sudden drops in quality were common issues I ran into. With HuluxTV, streams loaded faster and stayed stable more often than what I experienced with other IPTV Providers, which made a noticeable difference in day-to-day use.\n\n**Devices and Setup Experience 📱💻**\n\nI tested this IPTV Service on several devices, including a TV, a streaming device, a phone, and a computer. Setup was simple, and performance stayed fairly consistent across devices. That wasn’t always the case with other IPTV Providers, where the experience changed depending on the platform.\n\n**Final Thoughts 📝**\n\nAfter spending time comparing different options, HuluxTV ended up being the IPTV Service I continued using because it held up better over time. Everyone’s needs are different, but for my usage, this IPTV subscription stayed reliable when others didn’t.\n\nIf anyone wants to share their experience with IPTV Providers or talk about what they look for in an IPTV Service, feel free to join the discussion.",

      "selftext": "I’ve always heard Stripe was the \"infrastructure powering the internet economy,\" so I dug into their story and wow.\nStripe wasn’t built with a flashy launch or VC hype. It started in 2010 when two Irish brothers, Patrick and John Collison, realized how painful it was to accept payments online. So they built a few lines of code that made it simple.\n\nWhat blew my mind:\n\nStripe started as /dev/payments, and early users included Shopify, Lyft, and Kickstarter\n\nThey raised from Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Sequoia, all in their seed round\n\nGrew quietly but rapidly, hitting a $95B valuation by 2021\n\nStayed private while generating billions in revenue and serving millions of businesses\n\nExpanded beyond payments into fraud detection, tax compliance, virtual cards, and even incorporation through Stripe Atlas\n\nTheir culture is famously intense, long-form memos &gt; meetings, and their API docs are basically gold-standard\n\nThey’ve processed hundreds of billions in volume, power companies in 46+ countries, and still haven’t gone public.\n\nI broke down the full journey, from 7 lines of code to becoming the financial layer of the internet in this [blog](https://www.plox.in/blog/stripe-story-growth-revenue)\n\nWould love to hear your take on this!",

His actual writing style, reproduced to PERFECTION.   \n  \nI've been thinking about it for days now because of what it means for everything we've built on signature verification. Banks verify signatures, notaries rely on them, and contracts depend on them. We've structured our entire trust systems around the idea that handwriting is unique to each person. but is it anymore?   \n  \nnow a student can generate something convincing enough to pass basic human review using a free tool. The calculus homework looked completely legit to the naked eye. That's the part that's messing with me. If I didn't know it was AI-generated, I wouldn't have questioned it for a second.   \n  \nWe've already seen this pattern play out with forged photo IDs and \"perfect\" proofs of address. Handwriting is just the next tool in the box. And unlike fake IDs, this one can lead to mortgage fraud, forged authorizations, account takeovers. All of it gets easier. Most verification systems were designed for a world where imitating someone's identity took time, skill, and physical access. That world is gone. I keep wondering if the fix is better detection tech, or if we need to rethink signature-based verification entirely. Maybe biometrics? maybe something else?   \n  \nI feel like we're maybe 12 or 18 months away from this being a real operational problem but I honestly have no idea if I'm early or already late",

      "selftext": "I was looking into how different banks handle fraud detection for a project and stumbled onto something Barclays did that I can't stop thinking about.\n\nmost fraud systems I've seen work like this: security team builds something \"robust\" and \"aggressive,\" ships it, moves on. then six months later product is scrambling because trust metrics are tanking and support tickets are through the roof.\n\nthe problem isn't that these systems fail to catch fraud. it's that they flag too many legitimate people in the crossfire. every false positive is a blocked transaction. every blocked transaction is a \"yes, that really was me\" message. every one of those is a customer doing work your system should've handled on its own.\n\nBarclays apparently flipped the whole approach. instead of optimizing for security first and smoothing friction later, they designed for customer experience from the start and built security into that foundation.\n\nthree things stood out: their ML engine thinks in milliseconds but behaves more like a human analyst. they run continuous feedback loops - model retraining, testing, error audits - so the system doesn't drift over time. And when they do block a transaction, they actually explain why. not \"suspicious activity detected\" but \"this differs from your normal spending pattern because X, Y, Z.\"\n\nthat last part is what got me. most systems just block you and make you prove yourself. Barclays tells you the reasoning. seems small but I think that's actually the difference between a customer who shrugs it off and one who starts looking for a new bank.\n\nmost fintechs treat fraud as a backend compliance function. Barclays treated it as a customer experience problem that happens to involve security.\n\ndo you think this approach actually scales or is it one of those things that only works when you have Barclays-level resources? I keep going back and forth on whether this is a genuine competitive advantage or just good PR that falls apart under pressure.",

You can appeal and wait 30 days.”\n\nNo reason given.\n\nNo summary of their decision.\n\nNo timeline to recover my funds.\n\nResult:\n\n\\- €50,000 frozen\n\n\\- Business operations halted\n\n\\- Dozens of detailed emails ignored, no clear response\n\n\\- My opinion after this experience\n\nWise is no longer a reliable solution for professionals.\n\nThey act like a bank — but without transparency, accountability, or logic.\n\nTheir compliance team feels robotic, demanding contradictory and absurd documents, often impossible for small businesses to provide.\n\nAnd the worst part: they can shut down your account without warning, even if your file is clean.\n\nHonestly, it’s shameful.\n\nI regret ever trusting them.\n\nIf your business relies on Wise — withdraw your funds while you still can.\n\n❓Questions for the community\n\nHas anyone else here had their Wise account closed with money stuck inside?\n\nHow long did it take before you got your funds back?",

      "selftext": "**Context**\n\nI'm the Director of Performance at a mid-size performance &amp; creative agency based in London. We're currently running across 30-40 accounts. I work across both Meta &amp; Google directly (Our team is small but mighty!), with SC, Pinterest, Bing etc sprinkled in. We work with the likes of large, £200k a week spends to £1k. I also personally have a lot of experience in B2B also.\n\n  \n**General Advice I think can make a difference**\n\n1. **Paid Advertising Alone Won’t Save Your Business**\n   * **Why Paid is Limited:**\n      * Paid advertising thrives at the bottom of the funnel, targeting people who are already familiar with your brand or actively searching for your product. Its shit for stable new customer acquisition.\n      * Relying solely on paid ads will cap your growth—paid works best as a stable support structure, not the foundation.\n   * **What Really Drives Growth:**\n      * Focus on building **brand awareness** through organic efforts and creative outreach. The founders going out and doing the ground work are what allows us to scale businesses more rapdily, paid growth is incremental and painful.\n      * This applies to businesses of all sizes—from startups spending £1,000 per week to major retailers like Holland &amp; Barrett.\n2. **Evaluate Every Step of the User Journey**\n\n   * **Understand Where Conversions Drop:**\n      * Many founders &amp; businesses overlook the importance of optimising the entire funnel. If in-platform CPA spikes, they're sitting ducks.\n      * It’s not just about driving traffic; it’s about what happens after users land on your site, the checkout, the repurchasing.\n   * **Key Areas to Review:**\n      * Conversion rates: Are website visitors turning into customers?\n      * Traffic flow: Where are users dropping off in the journey?\n   * **The Real Difference Makers:**\n      * While paid ads (e.g., Meta) can lower CPA by 20–40%, the **big wins** come from CRO (Conversion Rate Optimisation) and CRM (Customer Relationship Management) after for ssuatinable business frowth.\n\n# Platform Notes\n\n# Meta Advertising Structures\n\n1. **Campaign Structures That Work**\n   * Bottom-of-Funnel (BoF):\n      * Allocate \\~10% of your total budget.\n      * Target conversions and optimise for lower-funnel activity.\n   * Top-of-Funnel (ToF):\n      * Use the remaining budget, but still optimise for conversions (not awareness).\n      * Apply an Advantage+ Shopping Campaign (ASC) targeted toward bottom-line conversions.\n   * Pure Top-of-Funnel Awareness Campaigns:\n      * Only viable if you’re spending significant sums and can let them run long-term.\n2. **The Organic Effect**\n   * What is it?\n      * The organic effect is the correlation between your Meta ad spend and organic or direct traffic not tracked by Meta.\n      * Meta’s attribution is unreliable—monitor blended CPA instead of in-platform CPA.\n   * Key Takeaway:\n      * Look at the overall business impact (e.g., total sales, organic traffic, and blended CPA) rather than just Meta’s reported metrics. *They lie a lot.*\n3. **Campaign Types: ASC vs. CBO/ABO**\n   * Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns (ASC):\n      * Highly effective \\~70–80% of the time.\n   * CBO (Campaign Budget Optimization) and ABO (Ad Set Budget Optimization):\n      * Consider only for larger budgets (e.g., £100k/week or more).\n4. Attribution\n   * 7 day Click\n      * Currently find this to be a winner more foten than not, but it's a painful transtion.\n      * From what we can tell, 1 day view takes in any impression from the user to attribute a sale, which is a tad BS.\n\n# Google\n\n* **Brand Search &amp; Shopping:**\n   * Allocate 5–10% of the budget.\n   * Use high target CPA/ROAS for brand shopping. The algo will naturlaly gravitate to your brand terms (Y*ou can't target brand terms in shoppping for those that are new!*)\n* **Performance Max (PMAX):**\n   * Exclude brand traffic for better new customer prospecting.\n   * Use lower target ROAS for scaling.\n* **Non-Brand Search:**\n   * Foundational but challenging and expensive to optimise.\n   * Requires a significant budget for effective testing.\n* **Campaign Structures:**\n   * Single product: 2–3 campaigns max.\n   * Multiple products: Use product-split PMAX campaigns, not sure why people don't do this more often.\n\nFeel free to AMA below, the info above should be generally useful for most businesses. \n\n  \n",

I started testing some of the “free followers” sites floating around just to see if they actually work, and surprisingly a few of them do deliver without asking for crazy stuff like passwords.\n\nHere are the ones I tried: •\tsmmsumo – They give you 200 free followers right away, no password needed. Delivery is pretty quick too. •\tqqsumo – Similar deal, pretty simple claim process, works well if you just want to bump up your numbers a bit. •\tfollowerszeal – Their free trial worked for me, though the speed was a little slower compared to smmsumo. •\talwaysviral – Decent option, gives you a small free pack, and they have some other social platforms too. •\tqqhippo – Another one I tested, legit and easy to claim, nothing shady.\n\nNote that you can use only one ip in a day.\n\nNot saying this is going to magically blow up your account (you still need content, consistency, etc.), but if you just want a little starter push in 2026 , these are the ones that worked for me personally.\n\nAnyone else tried these or found other sites that actually deliver free followers without spammy stuff?

Fix your Core Web Vitals, mobile responsiveness, and site structure before obsessing over link building.\n3. **Backlinks from relevant sites beat backlinks from high DA sites** \\- A link from a niche blog with 1K monthly visitors in your industry is worth more than a link from a generic news site with millions of visitors.\n4. **Your competitors are probably stealing your strategy** \\- And that's fine. SEO isn't a zero-sum game. There's room for multiple winners in most niches.\n5. **Local SEO is criminally underrated** \\- If you have any local component to your business, the ROI on local SEO efforts is insane compared to competing nationally.\n6. **The best keyword tool is Reddit/Quora/Forums** \\- Paid tools are great, but real people asking real questions in your niche will show you what they actually care about (not just what has high search volume).\n7. **You'll lose rankings sometimes, and that's okay** \\- I used to panic every time I dropped 3 positions.

Retargeting with social proof = low-hanging fruit\nI always set up a retargeting ad with reviews/testimonials — works way better than I expected and it's cheap.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n4. Landing page speed and checkout UX matters\nI didn’t care much before, but fixing some speed and checkout flow issues doubled one of my campaign ROAS.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n5. Don’t panic early\nI’ve had ads that looked dead in the first 48 hours and then started printing results. I learned to wait and let the algo learn unless CPMs are crazy.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nThat’s it really. Not trying to pitch anything — just figured if I can save someone else a few wasted dollars or give you an idea, it’s worth sharing.\n\nIf anyone here is testing stuff and wants to chat or trade feedback, I’m down. Always learning.\n\nCheers 🙌\n",

      "selftext": "I post nerdy marketing insights here from time to time and here's another one.  \n\n\nThis is one is proven to get a +10% increase in CTR.\n\n\n\n**The study:**\n\nResearchers from the University of Mannheim ran a real-world experiment on a cleaning service website.\n\n\n\nThey tested 3 combinations of a headline and button text:\n\n1. The button copy repeated the same keywords used in the headline exactly\n\n2. The button copy had the “gist“ of the headline, using synonyms\n\n3. The button copy had a different text than the headline (Kutzner et al., 2024)\n\n\n\n**Here are the exact headlines and CTA’s they tested:**\n\n\n\nHeader 1: “**Dreaming** instead of cleaning”\n\nButton (Verbatim repetition): “At last, time for **dreaming**”\n\nButton (Gist repetition): “Relax now”\n\nButton (New message): “No more cleaning duties” or “A clean apartment without any stress”\n\n\n\nHeader 2: “No **stress** with cleaning”\n\nButton (Verbatim repetition): “A clean apartment without any **stress**”\n\nButton (Gist repetition): “No more cleaning duties”\n\nButton (New message): “Relax now” or “At last, time for dreaming”\n\n\n\n**What they found:**\n\nVerbatim repetition of the header words on the button led to the highest click-through rate (58-59%), compared to gist repetitions (48-51%) and new messages (42-45%).\n\n\n\n**Why?**\n\nOur brains don’t like to think.\n\nReading the same words twice, takes much less effort, than reading and processing new words.\n\nThis is called high processing fluency.\n\nOur brains mistake that ease for a good feeling and act on it.\n\nThat’s why “gist” repetition worked as well, but not as great, likely because the words weren’t identical, so they required slightly more cognitive effort to get.\n\n\n\n**Takeaway**\n\nA/B test repeating your headline key words in the button.   \n  \n  \nI've been dreaming of starting an ad psychology newsletter for a loooong time and I've finally taken the leap! \n\nI share things like what button shapes to use, what types of images work best in ads, why celebrity ads work, what works better $95 vs $97 vs $99, and more.\n\nIf you're a nerd like me and love research-based insights like this every week, search up my Ad Psychology Nerds newsletter on Google.",

      "selftext": "Hello Redditors,\n\nIn this post, I will share our insights and case study on how we grew an e-commerce clothing brand.\n\nI will keep it as short and straightforward as possible. Hopefully, you can apply this to your e-commerce store.\n\n**THE SITUATION**\n\n70% of revenue came from returning customers.\n\nThey didn't know their target CPA numbers. When they advertised, their target CPA was $15\n\nThey didn't know their LTV numbers\n\nThey were advertising all the products that they had, and only a few were generating sales\n\nThey were testing 1-2 new ads a month, and for the most part, they ran the same creatives repeatedly for the last 3 months.\n\nThey didn't have any email flows to retain more customers, although 70% of their monthly revenue came from fan customers, which meant the products were really good.\n\n\n**WHAT DID WE DO TO GROW THIS BRAND?**\n\n\n1. We calculated all the numbers to set a clear target cost to acquire new customers\n2. Instead of advertising all the products, we found that most sales came from 5 dresses.\n\nSo, we set our focus only on those 5 dresses.\n\nYou don't need to advertise all of your products. All you need to focus on is your HERO product/offer.  This is one of the reasons why I see a lot of brands fail to figure out their Facebook ads. They try to advertise all the products. It's hard enough to figure out the best way to advertise one hero product that is responsible for most of your sales. \n\nFocus on all your ad creation attention on the HERO product/offer.\n\n3) New creatives - previously, I mentioned that they were testing 1-2 new ads a month.\n\nWell, we started our ad launch we 40 ads showcasing the dresses in multiple videos like:\n\n- dress time capsule hacks for summer  \n- 3 reasons why you will love this dress  \n- 3 reasons why I hate these dresses ( negative angles also work)\n- vlog day with my 3 favorite outfits for the summer.\n\n\n4) We simplified the ad account structure with just 2 campaigns\n\n- Campaign for women with multiple testing ad sets showcasing best-selling dresses  \n- Campaign to join their special email VIP list to grow their email list.\n\nAll the campaigns used complete BROAD targeting, no retargeting ad sets, no interests, and no lookalikes.\n\nWe let ads do the targeting.\n\nMultiple ads had a frequency close to 2.0, meaning those ads were already retargeting.\n\nI don't want to get to deep into this retargeting, targeting conversation, I have other posts about this. That explains the concept behind \"ads do the targeting\"\n\n5) Regarding the email - we built :  \n- New welcome flow -  \n- VIP Flow -  \n- Birthday flow -  \n- We miss your flow  \n- Cart abandonment flow.  \nBy building these flows, we let email and SMS focus on customer retention rather than running Facebook retargeting campaigns\n\nA month after doing this, 80% of monthly revenue came from new customers.\n\nWe grew to $ 60,000 per month, staying for three months while the brand sorted out its inventory and focused on developing new dresses for limited availability drops.\n\n**THE CURRENT SITUATION**\n\n* Currently,  this brand is doing $100k - $120k in monthly sales.\n* 60-65% of revenue comes from new customers\n* 35-40% comes from returning customers\n* The average AOV is $92.43\n* Our Cost to acquire new customers is $55\n* Our LTV is $180+ and growing\n* Every 6 weeks, we launch new dress drops planned for a year.\n* All of this is without any monthly discount campaigns, pure product.\n* We run a discount once every 4 months and generate around $280 - $300k in that period.\n* We still don't use retargeting campaigns.\n* Customer retention is being handled by email &amp; SMS.\n\n**THE NEXT STEPS**\n\n1. We are implementing a loyalty program where we will offer cashback after a certain amount of spend in the store that will be kept as store credit and can be used in the next purchase. This will incentivize people to come back and spend more, which will result in raising our LTV.\n2. Conquer new markets to grow to $300k monthly without sales campaigns. After a year, we can finally do that because we have a healthy profit margin and good customer retention.\n3. Develop new products that people love.\n\nThanks for reading.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nAs I'm sure you've all noticed, digital marketing is turning itself inside out coming to terms with AI and how it impacts our work. Lately, I've seen a flood of AI \"tools\" being promoted that advertise AI solutions for this and that, from text to imagery, and more.\n\nFirst of all, this subreddit was created to exist as a watercooler safe space for digital marketers who don't have anyone in their company or circle of friends to discuss their professional challenges. And our 1st and most important rule is no solicitation. There are no sales pitches at the watercooler, and even actual advice is suspect the moment it's attached to *\"and this thing you can buy will solve your problems\"*.\n\nI'm happy to reconsider the above and tweak (minimally) this rule if the community has a different point of view (comment below), but for now, that's the state of things.\n\n# Now to the issue at hand\n\nI'd like to urge everyone to learn to use AI, as it's going to be an unavoidable tool in our arsenal going forward but to be weary about the deluge of tools that claim to perform miracles.\n\nThere are a handful of AIs good enough to use today (ChatGPT and Midjourney being well-known examples), as well as an absolute dumpster fire of front-end interfaces that query the aforementioned AIs via API. I've tried a dozen, and they rarely add significant value beyond what the core tools themselves do. If anything, they add a layer of obscurity on top of the query-response process, which isn't doing the user any favors.\n\nThe vast majority of these hastily cobbled tools won't exist in a year. Please consider the implications of giving your money, personal data, and work data to a platform that's only forwarding your content to a different API. Consider the implications of not having access to any of your history when the garage projects inevitably drown in the sea of indistinguishable competitors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn light of this, we'll take a stronger moderation approach to removing the promotion of derivative AI tools and promotion. We'll also begin to enforce a zero-tolerance approach to promotion that seeks to circumvent the automod tools, such as posts that appeal to PM for more info or mention links in bios.\n\n**This is a community for PEOPLE who share a passion and profession to talk to each other, and not a community where you're sold to.** If you'd like that, I'm sure you can find any number of digital marketing communities out there where you can read sales pitches and promos.\n\nAs always, if you have ANY comments about the above moderation direction, let me know. Please keep them on the community moderation topic, if you'd like to write a lengthy post about the direction of AI and have that discussion, do post it and PM me, we probably could use a sticky for that debate for a while.",

      "selftext": "As a Facebook ads consultant with years of experience in running and managing campaigns for business owners, I’ve learned a lot over the years. From working with hundreds of businesses and managing over $6 million dollars on Facebook advertising, I’ve developed some key insights into what works and what doesn't when it comes to successful campaigns on Facebook. \n\nIn this short post, I want to share these lessons with you so that you can apply them to your own business or clients' campaigns. Whether you're just starting out or have been running Facebook ads for a while, I hope that there is something here for everyone. \n\n## The quality of your traffic matters more than quantity.\n\nHaving 100 quality clicks on an ad is much more valuable than 100,000 low-quality ones. In actually, the more low-quality traffic you send to your website, the harder it will be to have long-term results. Low-quality traffic affects your Pixel data and the conversion optimization within ads manager.\n\n## Give your ads time to optimize before turning them off\n\nSo many times with the campaigns that I manage, I'll have a brand new campaign perform poorly for a couple of days and then on day 4, the results improve drastically to make up for the poor performance days... and much more. Had I turned off the ads after a day or two out of impatience, then  I would have missed out on this great performance.\n\n## The fix for your low performing ads is MUCH more than just one single small little fix. \n\nI've made a more detailed post on this point a year or two ago, but to quickly summarize it, most people think that it's just the one small thing to fix their ads. I've had so many consulting calls where a client will show me their Facebook ad account and say \"I feel like if I just knew what targeting to do, it would fix everything\" when their ad copy is confusing, their budget is spread too thin, and the creative is low-quality. The worst part about the situation is they don't know that there are so many other problems to fix that won't be resolved by just having that one interest.\n\n## Confusing ads will waste a lot of your ad spend\n\nThe point of ads on Facebook is to grab their attention and then make an offer to the viewer. If you grab their attention, and the ad is super confusing then they are just going to skip the ad because they don't want to take the time to understand what it's about. What I try to do with the ads I make for my clients is make it where the main point of the ad can be understood within 3 seconds. This is done either with a creative that is very easy to understand or adding enough context in the headline or the top of the primary text ad copy.\n\n## Let go of any emotional attachment to ads that don't perform well\n\nLearning how to let go of ads that don't perform well has been something I've had to come to terms with in my experience managing over $6 million dollars on Facebook Ads. It's easy to get attached to your ideas and feel like you need to give them a chance, but learning when something isn't working is essential for optimizing performance. When ads don't meet their goals and objectives it's important to recognize that, come up with a plan going forward, and move on from the one that isn't delivering results. In order for us all to be successful we need to take our lumps and use whatever data we have collected from unsuccessful campaigns in order to benefit future ones.\n\nThese are just a few of the lessons that I’ve learned over the years from managing campaigns for hundreds of businesses and investing over $6 million in Facebook ads. With these key takeaways, I hope that you can apply them to your own business or clients’ campaigns to help\n\nAnd if you're still struggling, remember that this community is here to help. So if you need some extra one on one help achieving your marketing goals, I'm always happy to chat.\n\nI hope this post has been helpful in providing you with some tips and tricks for managing a successful Facebook ad campaign. Remember, it takes time to optimize your ads but if you stick with the process, I'm sure you will start seeing results!",

Built and grown a network of over 800k followers myself, eventually sold them. Started working as a SMM for brands, theme pages and local business in a variety of niche - finance, fitness, tech etc. \n\nWhile working as a SMM, I found out about Funnel building, dived deep into it and eventually started my first agency as a funnel building one - I now have more than 2 years of experience in building end to end funnels for my clients, helped local business, dentists , fitness coach and others to maximise their cash flow (In simple words: made their website better and helped them generate more sales)\n\nThe second one is my fav one, in the past two years I have built my own Influencer marketing agency (IMA) it's more like a talent management one (in the creators side), closed deals worth more than $30k in just past 8 months. Majority in the Australian market, a few in the US.\n\nThe third is my video editing agency, hardly 6 months back, it isn't as successful as others, still made something (and it was fun messing with edits)\n\nAnd yup every business was built upon Instagram.\n\nMy honest take? It isn't hard as people make it to be, you just have to a hell lotta consistent even if things ain't working out. \nWork hard and keep on Upskilling yourself. That's the Mantra that worked out for me!\n\nIf I had to chose one skill I would learn the first is Sales - from prospecting, outreach and negotiating. Sales is the skill that makes you THE MONEY! No matter how skilled are you, if you can't effectively sell your service out there - you can't make money. It's as simple as that.\n\nDon't shy away from asking questions (I used to ask the dumbest question - best decision ever) drop your messages",

      "title": "How To Make Your Link Building Work",
      "selftext": "Found some interesting and helpful articles here so thought I’d chime in with something of my own after seeing so much misinformation etc. Building links is probably the hardest part of SEO. There’s misinformation at every turn. The majority of large link building/buying agencies fuel a lot of this leading to business owners and other SEOs getting it wrong too.\n\n\n\nOne of THE main issues is most agencies slap links anywhere. Content will go up that’ll never have a chance in hell of ranking, or they’ll throw link inserts into dead content (a lot of the time onto sites that are also dead). This kind of link building pales in comparison to the below. \n\n\n\nI just wanted to cover off what's pretty impactful for us at the moment and chat about why it isn’t common practice, and why you should (be it for your own business, or client’s business) try for the below for more consistent results, especially in harder niches with more difficult/competitive keywords.\n\n\n\n# Get it into Ranking content\n\n\n\nThe content the link sits in should in the best world receive traffic from Google. Why? Because it's showing Google values the content/page enough to send traffic to it. If google values the page, logically we can infer that it’ll value the links on the page too. So - is the website ranking, is the content ranking, and is it receiving some traffic? If those are a tick - great. \n\n\n\nIf its just ranking for keywords, but not receiving traffic - the page is still probably valued, as Google has ranked it. But clearly not as valuable as getting traffic. It depends on your goals, budget, and competition.\n\n\n\nSO - your goal should be to secure links in ranking content (if a link insert) or to get the submitted content (which includes your link) to rank. It can be time consuming on a link by link basis, but it’ll make all the difference to your campaign (rather than throwing links up into dead content or even dead websites!)\n\n\n\n There are two main ways you can do this. \n\n# Link insert method:\n\n\n\nPretty logical. You need to insert your link into content that is indexed, ranking for keywords, and receiving traffic. A lot of agencies are known to just throw them into content doing nothing, even worse, on sites that are completely dead - so watch out for this, and, if you’re doing this yourself make sure you’re inserting them into trusted (by Google) content.\n\n  \n\n\n# New Article method:\n\n\n\nA little more difficult because, obviously, the content won’t be ranking/receiving content if its brand new - however, you can give it the best chance of succeeding and also, you’ll have full control over the content unlike when you’re doing an insert.\n\n\n\nSo - for the link within your article to get the best pull, you need to rank it should go something like this: \n\n\n\n* Write a quality article targeting a keyword the site can logically rank for (and doesn’t already rank for). It shouldn’t be super difficult. You can work with the owner to achieve this.\n* Leverage the sites current authority to support the website: during negotiation for the placement ensure internal links (again - from other ranked articles getting traffic) are pushed to your new article to give it the best chance of ranking. \n\n\n\nIf it ranks - the link will pull a lot harder than if the content was simply indexed and not ranked, if it ranks well and gets some traffic that’s even better.\n\n\n\nIn our experience - this kind of link building is way more impactful and will lead Google to trust your site/page and think of it as more of an authority.\n\n  \n\n\n# Why Isn’t this common Practice?\n\n\n\nThere are a few reasons. \n\n\n\n* It takes a lot longer to secure each placement \n* They cost a lot more (if you’re paying sites)\n* Sites are far more protective of their articles that already rank (why add do follow links to ranked content/Content thats driving traffic when changing the content could mess something up…sites don’t like it.\n* Slapping links on dead sites etc., is cheaper, and faster and why many do so. Its why many price based on DA/DR etc. A site with 0 traffic can quite easily have a DA of 80. \n\n\n\nSo - when you build links try to do your all to make them work. If you’re working with an agency, hold them to account. Just looking at inserts think of them on a scale:\n\n\n\nLevel one (links on a site with 0 traffic/ranking) Worthless\n\nLevel two (links on a site that gets real traffic from google but not the page) Better - but there are steps to take (ask for internal links etc. but really for for three and four if you can).\n\nLevel three (links on a page that ranks for real keywords on google) much better, the page is trusted\n\nLevel four (links on a page that gets traffic from Google) the best.\n\n\n\nSo many agencies do level one, and business owners do too because the site might have a high DA (means nothing) and they’re led into it thinking the site is good. Remember, DA is third party and not representative of how much Google trusts a site, which can be ascertained simply by looking at whether the site gets real traffic or not.\n\n\n\nAlso - theres a level 1.5 - which are sites that look like that have traffic, but don’t. These are favoured by agencies too but a lot of the time the traffic is spoofed.\n\n\n\nSO. If you want the building to work focus on three and better yet, four. Its what we’ve seen work very well. YES - it might cost more (both in terms of time if you’re doing them for free, or money (the more common way) but they work.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nI’m only commenting on what I’ve seen work best. Its not to say other methodologies do not work. But, if you think about it the above is quite logical. For us, that kind of link building punches harder for clients than putting up content on dead sites without trying to rank the content and get the content some real traffic flow. \n\n\n\nThis method pretty much concerns the paid way of securing links too (as that's where my experience lies and always has done). But, It can be applied to free link building methodologies its just way harder to do.\n\n\n\nAnyway - hope this was useful. \n\n  \n",

Meanwhile, I made less than a part-time fast-food worker.  \nHere’s what worked, and why I’m rethinking agency.\n\nI basically built a turnkey marketing department. I handle the entire lead flow + all things digital, they handle the sales and the roofs.\n\nI'm responsible for:\n\n1. Branding, Website, Landing Pages, tracking stack (calls, forms, automations)\n2. Google Ads + Meta Ads strategy, ad creatives and management\n3. CRM setup, management, automations, monitoring and training staff to use it.\n4. Full funnel analytics (Pixel, GA4, GTM, GSC) + automated setup of offline events data to Meta/Google\n5. Google Business Profile + Reputation Management + fundamental SEO setup/Link building\n6. Social media management with multiple weekly posts across FB/IG/TikTok\n7. Logo, Branding, Leaflets.\n8. I handled the first few months of the inbound lead calls, before I convinced them to hire a call center.\n\n# Outcome (18 months):\n\n**Revenue:** $0 → **$2.2 million**\n\n* **2024 (Apr–Dec):** 189 estimates - $5,124,998; 44 jobs sold = **$828k rev / $211k profit**\n* **2025 (Jan–Sep):** 404 estimates - $14,857,432; 91 jobs sold = **$1.38M rev / $317k profit**\n\n**Profit margin:** 30%  \n**Avg job:** $14–15k  \n**Close rate:** \\~22%  \n**Marketing cost:**\n\n* 2024 ad spend $30,684 + my fee $8,500 = **$39,185 total**\n* 2025 ad spend $61,871 + my fee $36,000 = **$97,871 total**\n\n**ROI:**\n\n* 2024: every $1 in marketing → **$21.1 in revenue; $6.3 in profit**\n* 2025: every $1 in marketing → **$14.1 in revenue; $4.2 in profit**\n* Marketing fees in 2025 = ad spend is 4.5% of rev + my fee came out to 2.6% of rev = **7.1% of total revenue**.\n\n**CAC/LTV** = 3.91:1  \n**Unconverted estimate value:** $13.48M in 2025 (90.7% of quoted) vs $4.3M in 2024 (83.8%).\n\n# What I did, step-by-step:\n\n**#1) High intent first - Google Ads.**\n\nThey had very limited budget to spend at first, so I focused on the people who are already searching for someone to come help them fix their roof - guaranteed high intent, bottom-of-funnel traffic = Google Search Ads. The average price per click here is \\~$60 , very pricy and hard to compete.\n\nI built out a website and dozens of landing pages to target the exact searches people were making and added dynamic text data based on searches and location like \"\\[search term\\] service in \\[location\\]\". I optimized the pages continuously by A/B testing. I tracked all interactions on landing pages, watched back every visitors session and consulted the heatmaps of common scroll/click areas. Basically, i did all i could to maximize the google ads click to conversion %. Important to note, that I originally went into agency space as a web dev/web designer and have solid background in making high conversion websites.\n\n*In the end, i got the landing* *page conversion rate to \\~21%*\n\n**#2) Fix response gap**\n\nOnce a lead comes in, its incredibly important that we are responsive. *All phone calls need to be answered, all form fills need to be called back in less than 5 minutes.*\n\nProblem = roofers/home service guys are notoriously bad at pickup up phones. They’re on roofs, driving, or quoting. But if a call isn’t answered, they don't convert and then my client sees that as a “bad lead”, which in turn looks bad on me.\n\nSo at first, I took on the role of picking up the phone calls. After five months I convinced them to sign up for a call center service. Better than nothing, but still very weak. There is no incentive for call center reps, I'm convinced that if my client just hired an in-house CSR / sales admin, our overall close rates would skyrocket and the wages would pay themselves off.\n\n**#3) Feed the algorithm**\n\nNow that we were getting lots of \"conversion\" data from landing page forms or calls - it was my priority to keep feeding the Google ads machine learning algo with more data about how these conversions are actually doing.\n\nI coached client on CRM pipelines and keeping estimates/invoice data attached to leads. I then created automations to feed all the data about qualified/disqualified leads, $ value of estimates sold/unsold, etc.\n\nThis is makes the Google ads/Meta ads targeting a lot smarter AND gave us fully transparent analytics, reporting exactly what's working and where we have leaks that need patching.\n\n**#4) Add Meta for scale**\n\nBy this point we were first for our service areas in Google Ads auction insights and because its a very specialized niche of roofing, there is simply not enough search volume and our budget outgrew what Google was willing to spend. Google local service ads were also useless, as it classifies you as a \"roofing contractor\", but 95% of those leads are not applicable for this client.\n\nWe were capped on lead volume of the high intent, bottom of the funnel traffic that Google ads brings and to increase lead flow I went on to expand to a colder audience with Meta Ads. to increase lead flow, I went to Meta Ads.\n\nHere, my strategy is much simpler - reverse engineer what works. I watched over 1200 roofing video ads. I know this number because i took notes on each one, noting the hooks, specific sentences i liked, notes on the script, visual elements, different angles/approaches, etc. I built a whole library of ideas and have been testing creatives based off that, occasionally going back to the Meta ad library and watching some more. Because we introduced Meta ads around the same time that we introduced social media posts, there was plenty of already prepared footage from the job sites for me to use.\n\nThis year, Meta ads has been the main source of leads. The quality is considerably worse (95% qualified -&gt; 50% qualified), Because we still don't have an in-house CSR, the time to call back new leads is way longer than it should be, so this artificially brings down the % of qualified meta leads. Although the price per lead currently comes out to be worse, the average ticket is equally good.\n\n**#5) Build Trust and Authority**\n\nThroughout this whole time, I was doing two other things to increase the trust and authority in the eyes of potential prospects. Hunting for Google reviews from our sold jobs &amp; getting the client to film content on job sites for social media / meta ads.\n\nI built in automations for simple review gathering from sold jobs. Every added review is massive for local reputation. If a someone is considering spending thousands of dollars for a huge job, you best believe they are gonna be searching you and your competitors up, yet many other companies don't even any form of online presence so we simply appear more trust worthy and reputable by staying on top of it.\n\nWith the filming of content - the primary usecase is for Meta ads, which are the actual money generating bit. And although we do not get direct jobs from social media posts (yet), I think it has a great impact for long term brand building &amp; adding trust when leads research us further before making a decisions. Simply by posting videos from active job sites for 9 months, we got a total of 10k subscribers &amp; 14.2m views across FB/TikTok/IG, all of which shows up very obviously when looking at branded keyword searches of the company.\n\nAll these systems now produce steady inbound calls, track every quote, and feed back performance to ads.\n\n# Future Growth\n\nCurrent bottleneck is the sales conversion, as you saw earlier from the \"Unconverted estimate value\" - only 9.3% of estimate value converts. The fastest profit lever for the client is in lifting the estimate win rate on higher ticket jobs. Our overall close rate of 22% is highly propped up by small residential repair jobs, meanwhile, there is a big loss on the higher ticker commercial jobs.\n\nThis is outside of what I can currently help with, so I pushed for an experienced roofing sales consultant to train the team and Client agreed. I want that playbook so future clients get even more from me, a full sales process that converts high-ticket work.\n\nI want to further systematize the sales journey: same-hour follow-up, better roof report/estimate process for the client, maintenance agreements for commercial job retention, etc.\n\nHowever, before I go any further with this, i had to stop and ask myself\n\n# Was it even worth it?\n\nThe company sold $2.2M of work in 18 months, and pocketed around $518k of profit.\n\nMy total take across that time = **$16.5k in 2024 + $36k in 2025 = $52.5k total revenue, about $25.5k profit for all of my labor hours put into this**.\n\nThat’s **2.3% of total revenue** for building and managing the entire lead engine, creatives, systems, data. Basically full control over their marketing engine and measurable ROI.\n\nLooking at it strictly as an agency owner, **I basically built a multi-million-dollar business acquisition channel for a client, for about the same profit as working part-time at McDonald’s.** Now I have to decide whether that was a smart long-term play or bad pricing.\n\n# So here's my question\n\nWas this the right move?\n\nOn paper, it’s a great case study:\n\n* $0 → $2.2M in 18 months\n* 14× return on ad spend\n* $4.2 of pure profit for every $1 spent on marketing/fees\n* Every lead source and dollar tracked to the cent\n\nBut in practice, I spent hundreds of hours building and running everything and cleared \\~$25k profit. Below the poverty line where I live.\n\nThis is only “worth it” if I can turn it into a repeatable offer for other roofing companies.  \nThat’s where I’m stuck.\n\nHow do you even sell something like this? Content ads into a VSL funnel targeted at roofers?\n\n* Do I pitch it as a **full-funnel service** (ads, CRM, analytics, etc.)?\n* Do I go **flat retainer, % of ad spend, % of revenue, or profit share?**\n* When do you move from “cheap case study” to proper pricing?\n* Would you have front-loaded this much work for the long game?\n\nWould love perspective from other agency owners or general business owners.",

      "selftext": "Since 2015, I have provided a variety of Facebook ad services to varying degrees. At this point I've managed over $6 million in ad spend and have managed campaigns for dozens of clients, I've consulted and audited with hundreds of businesses, and I've worked on thousands of different Facebook ad campaigns.\n\nWhat I've noticed is that people are always looking for a new Facebook ad hack or scaling strategy to try out. The problem with this is you never give yourself time to master any one strategy.\n\nIn my time of running Facebook ads, there has only been one major change to the itself platform and that was with the iOS update in 2021. Yes there have been economic changes and changes to the way people consume content or the like but those are things that only require a slight shift in strategy to stay on top of.\n\nSo when the iOS update dropped in 2021 and the results of my clients started to decline, I had to make a new campaign structure and strategy to adapt to that big change in the platform to start seeing results again. Ever since then it's been performing extremely consistent with the right optimizations and customizations for each client and audience size.\n\nThere are 3 types of campaigns in this structure:\n\n1 - Capture campaigns\n\n2 - Nurture campaigns\n\n3 - Convert campaigns\n\nCapture and nurture campaigns are essential to all business sizes, but the third convert campaign isn't necessary for smaller stores or stores with less data. In that case, the nurture/convert campaigns become 1 all together.\n\nBefore going into what each campaign consists of, I need to stress that this campaign strategy cannot work with bad products or offers. Also, all campaigns use the conversion objective optimized for purchases. No traffic campaigns, no video view campaigns, no brand awareness campaigns, etc. ALL conversion/sales.\n\nAnd I could literally talk for hours and hours on the ins and outs of this campaign structure and strategy, but for this post I am just going to be very brief to provide a general understanding. I've made a lot of old posts going into more detail on this if you're interested in learning more.\n\nCampaign 1 - Capture\n\nThese campaigns are all video ads and the main objective of these campaigns is to grow your custom audiences very quickly. So what you do is set an exclusion on all of the ad sets to exclude 3 second video views.\n\nFor every person that sees one of these ads, all they have to do is watch 3 seconds of one of the videos in order to become captured and part of your \"3 second video views\" audience\"\n\nThe beauty of setting that exclusion is you are forcing Facebook to keep on finding new people to show your ads to. Oftentimes people will convert at this level if they are impulse buyers.\n\nCampaign 2 - Nurture\n\nThese campaigns consist of a lot of different types of ads, such as video ads, carousels and single image ads. The main objective is to nurture the warm audiences you captured from your capture campaign.\n\nThe custom audiences I use in this campaign are typically as follows:\n\n1 - Website visitors\n\n2 - Social page engagement\n\n3 - Video views\n\nWhen this entire strategy is fully built out over time, the nurture campaign is the one with the highest ad spend and the highest ROAS.\n\nCampaign 3 - Convert\n\nThe convert campaign are the campaigns that you make that are focused on a very small and hot custom audience with a strong offer or call to action.\n\nAn example of the custom audiences in this campaign would be\n\n1 - 95% video views\n\n2 - Add to cart\n\n3 - Initiate checkout\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, these convert campaigns are not necessary for all ad accounts because it only reaches like 5 to 10% of your entire audience. So if you have a small store, you probably don't have enough data to utilize these campaigns with.\n\nTo conclude, my Facebook ad structure and strategy has been providing amazing results to my clients for years. It requires a lot of logical optimizations to keep it performing well, but it is well worth the time and energy when you start to see significant ROI from your ads. The key to success with this structure is making sure you have a solid product and that you are optimizing and customizing your campaigns to the feedback you are receiving from Facebook.\n\nI hope this post has helped provide some insight on what I consider to be the most effective way to structure and manage your Facebook ad campaigns today. Feel free to ask any questions as well, I'm always happy to help out. Thanks for reading!",

      "title": "Radical New Approach to Digital Marketing",
      "selftext": "I launched an apparel brand in 2018 with a friend and it almost failed during the first month because we were focusing our efforts on trying to reach consumers with ads in places where they weren't actively looking for our apparel. We tried Facebook and Instagram ads, Pinterest, and ran ads on Etsy to try and generate new customers for our Apparel line. While we had some sales, the cost to acquire a new customer was pretty close to our average profit per order making our advertising a wash. We were selling products, but we weren't making a profit. \n\nOur approach to spending money on ads that had no other benefit other than serving ad impressions and hoping for a buyer was getting us nowhere. It would be impossible for us to scale our brand and make a profit. \n\nThat's when we decided to shift our focus. Instead of spending money on ads, we started spending money on ads to reach targeted apparel Influencers who were interested in our type of Apparel. We ran Facebook and Instagram ads and targeted an audience who were interested in our niche but were also models, and actresses and had an interest in representing brands as a spokesperson. \n\nWe set up a \"Spokesperson\" contest and offered a $5,000 contract to the Spokesperson who created the best content for our apparel brand. Our ads were generating new Influencer sign-ups for about .34 cents each. With a small budget, we had over 10,400 Influencers sign up for the campaign. \n\nThe Spokesperson contest allowed Influencers to earn points for taking actions that helped the brand grow organically. Here's what we had the Influencers do to earn points:\n\n1. Purchase the product (at a discount) - 23% of the Influencers purchased our Apparel \n2. Create an unboxing video of the apparel when they got it\n3. Create a \"Review Video\" of them trying on and commenting on the apparel\n4. Follow us in social media\n5. Engage with our Social Media content\n6. Post their videos to their own social media channels and tag our brand in the post\n\nWe had the Influencers purchase our products on Amazon so we could grow the number of sales and generate reviews to help lift our apparel in organic search results on Amazon. This helped lower our blended cost of customer acquisition across all of our sales channels. \n\nHere are some of the benefits of running a campaign like this:\n\n**Build social media account authority** \\- The more account authority your social media accounts have, the better your content ranks in social media. For us, we wanted our content to rank on hashtags related to Yoga Apparel. We utilized \"Shoppable posts\" on Instagram so getting our Shoppable Post ranked at the top of the hashtag #YogaPants was imperative. \n\nThere are over 250k searches done an hour for that one Hashtag. When someone can purchase your product without leaving the post and it's visible to people actively looking for it, you generate a lot of sales. We generated over $34k an hour for each hour the post was ranked above the page fold on that one keyword. \n\nTo get ranked on that keyword, it took about 1500 likes and comments. Every time we launched a new \"Shoppable Post\" we would blast out a text message to our Influencers to like and comment on it. This drove our engagement up and got us ranked right away.\n\nSocial Account authority also drives more organic followers who all have high purchase intent as we are finding them on Hashtags that people looking to purchase Yoga Apparel search. As we build organic followers, our account authority gets higher and higher. \n\n**Evergreen Content** \\- Instead of paying for Ad Impressions, we pay for content creation that is always online and always driving more product discovery opportunities. Once your ad dollar is spent, you get no further benefit from it.\n\n**Build Strong Brand Affinity** \\- Ads don't drive passionate consumers of your products. But engaging social media influencers who are interested in your product category, incentivized to study your brand, create content for you and promote you for three months at a time drives very strong brand affinity. We created an active engagement automation funnel that kept our brand fully engaged with our Influencers throughout the entire campaign.\n\n**Generate Immediate Sales at a Lower CPA** \\- When we were marketing for sales, our average cost per sale was $29, when we ran the Influencer campaign and had Influencers purchase the product our cost per sale was just $3.44. We also gained a powerful brand advocate, generated evergreen content at scale, and built social media account authority.\n\nYou can use this business model to scale everything from product brands, Apps, Social Media platforms and everything in between. So, stop marketing for conversions and start acquiring brand advocates. It's the cheapest, most scalable way to build a brand that generates long-term value. Our apparel brand was acquired by one of the largest Yoga brands on the planet after just 9 months! Our campaign generated over $3M in revenue over our 3-month campaign with a tiny budget of just $30k.",

      "selftext": "Every..single...day I spend most of my mornings deleting garbage b2b cold emails, spammy LinkedIn messages, lazy outreach asking me to pay for services, etc. Every channel, everywhere, is filled with the next great AI tool or agency roadmap to 100x your MRR.\n\nThe entire industry is getting flipped upside down with the rise of AI and new software automation. Everyone is now an expert. But the truth is, the majority of what you see online is fake, written through prompts by users who don't actually understand the details about which they're talking. \n\nIt's enough to make most people run away. So why do I love it? \n\nBecause what I love about the industry and the reason I have been doing the work for over 10 years has nothing to do with me and everything to do with my ability (and team) to use our combined skills to support clients. Their goals, their mission, full stop. Only then can I succeed. It's validating in so many ways.\n\nLook around online. What you'll find is self-serving, grandiose promotions of someone pushing a way for THEMSELVES to make money. Downloads, workbooks, whatever funnel you can think of - it's all designed for them to get the quick win, not actually deliver something valuable or honest. I know this because I will often take the meetings, download the workbooks, demo the software, etc. I'm about my business, so I am always checking to see what works/what doesn't.\n\nBut if your focus is entirely on supporting your clients, helping them become successful, and providing real value to their business, you can't lose. There are more tools and resources available today than ever before, but most people are using them selfishly for their own gains and not to better the end clients who need it.\n\nSo if you see the chaos and feel overwhelmed or feel like you're missing out, just know it's not real. Most people don't want to do the real work in digital marketing because it's hard, takes time, and above all requires a sincere desire to communicate and collaborate with clients. It's also thankless and probably 80% of the real work no one will care about or care to understand. It is what it is.\n\nReal digital marketing is about taking complex topics and simplifying it so clients can understand the value and strategy they pay for. It's not about SEO, PPC, SMM, or any other three-letter trend that's out there today. Those are just tools. How YOU learn and adapt those tools to reach goals for others is where the real work is.\n\nRarely, if ever, do we receive calls from clients asking for a specific service outside of web design. If we do, the client admits they don't really know; they just thought it was so for one reason or another. They simply want to generate more leads, opportunities, or solve specific problems related to time or money. \n\nIf you only care about reaching goals and solving problems, the tools don't matter because you do whatever it takes to win. There are no quick wins, shortcuts, or secret sauce that will cheat Google. It's done through details and fundamentals, working with real clients and learning about their business so you can leverage your skills to promote them.\n\nSo bring on the chaos. Because no matter how fast the industry grows, it will never matter because the people who pay for marketing will never fully understand the nuances of the industry. They (clients) will always have a problem they need solved, goals they want to reach, or new opportunities they want to generate. Clients don't pay people they don't trust, and trust is earned through reputation and hard work. They don't care about jargon, fancy terms, or shiny objects you put in front of them. \n\nMake the phone ring. Get forms filled out. Make them make more money than they pay you (and be able to prove it). If you can't do those things, then you probably have less than 6 months of run time until the money call happens and you're looking for more work.",

      "selftext": "A lot of people don’t really understand the tools they now wield on a daily basis. Just look at the tiny % (but millions) who lost the plot when ChatGPT5 replaced 4o.\n\nI’ve been experimenting with vibe‑coding - building apps simply by telling AI what you want - for two years now. The last six months I’ve been deep in Claude Code. It’s so good… and so bad. Here’s why - and why this applies to every AI tool out there.\n\nThese tools open new worlds for marketing and sales teams. They can write for you, create audio or video, even build apps. They can control your machine, automate admin, make you feel unstoppable. On the surface, it all looks slick, fast, seductive. And sometimes, surface‐level is all you need - a quick image, a five‑second clip, a few ideas, or a whitepaper conclusion.\n\nBut surface‐level only takes you so far.\n\nTake vibe‑coding. Describe your dream app, and the AI will “build” it. It looks polished - until you realise it’s a house of cards: broken code, missing functions, outright fabrications. Building apps is hard.\n\nSame with content or video. No tool can yet write a 3,000‑word whitepaper end‑to‑end or produce a five‑minute promo video that’s truly ready to use.\n\nThe danger? These tools, and the hype, convince people otherwise. The apps look good; the content seems right; the images look fine until you squint. The confident “Yes, that’s brilliant” AI chatbot is seductive.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, these tools are the future of work. But we’re in the early days, a powerful, confident tech most don’t fully understand. Never before have people had tools that can do so much, yet are so misunderstood.\n\n**The answer?**\n\nHard work. I think it is simple as that, which no one wants to hear in an \"AI can do you work\" world. Right now AI can't do your work. But you are AI can do way better work.\n\nLearning how to use these tools is key. Understanding context windows, memory, model strengths. Getting good at guiding them, checking outputs, and knowing when not to use them. In short, rethink how you approach work—in tandem with AI, but in control of it.\n\nHere are 4 key tips for how to approach this new world of work:\n\n1. **Prioritise AI literacy over shortcuts** \\- Learn the fundamentals - how context limits, memory and hallucinations work. Use AI as a co‑pilot, not an autopilot. This prevents complacency and keeps you sharp.\n2. **Think human first - tech second** \\- Align AI tools with real business needs and culture. Set clear goals, assess risks, provide training. Human‑machine collaboration must be strategic, not reactive.\n3. **Master the art of prompting and iteration** Experiment with prompts, refine, validate, repeat. The value lies in iterative refinement—not handing off tasks wholesale to AI.\n4. **Agents work but you got to baby sit them** Often I can have 5 or 6 agents doing different 30 min tasks. Think about that, in 30 mins I can get 3.5hrs work done (3 by agents, 30 by me). But a lot of my 30mins is working with the agents to keep them on track. But its worth it for 3hrs free work!",

      "title": "The 6 quickest and easiest ways to get EU citizenship",
      "selftext": "Being an EU citizen is something that is coveted by a lot of people since it grants you free movement in almost all of Europe. And contrary to popular belief, it's actually not too difficult to get it now.\n\nEveryone knows that getting married to an EU citizen is one of the most effective ways to get EU citizenship yourself, but that's not a very viable option for most people so here are the 6 best ways to acquire it outside of marriage from quickest onwards:\n\n**1.) Ancestry - 6-12+ months (citizenship application processing time)**\n\nIf you have eligible ancestry from certain EU countries, you could automatically qualify for citizenship after some paperwork and bureaucracy.\n\nThere are different requirements for this (including proof that your ancestors were citizens), but some of them even allow you to go as far back as your great-grandparents (or even further) whereas others only go as far back as your parents so take a look and see if you qualify:\n\n* Austria\n* Belgium\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czechia\n* Denmark\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Ireland\n* Italy\n* Latvia\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Malta\n* Netherlands\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n\nAnd then there's the EFTA countries which also grant freedom of movement in the EU:\n\n* Iceland\n* Liechtenstein\n* Norway\n* Switzerland\n\nEach one of these has its own requirements so if you think you might have provable descent from one of them, read up on it and who knows, you might just get lucky.\n\n**2.) Malta's Golden Visa program - 1 year (1 year of residency in Malta + €750k contribution)**\n\nThere are a few Golden Visa programs in Europe, but Malta is the only one that offers citizenship after just a year of residency. The catch is that you have to invest at least €750k in Malta's National Development and Social Fund.\n\nNote that this is not a real estate or business investment that would give you a financial ROI (those do exist too, but aren't as great anymore compared to the other options below), but rather more of a non-refundable donation to the country.\n\nSo in essence, you're simply buying an EU passport at a super high price.\n\nIf you want to save €150k, you could also donate a lower amount of €600k instead, but you'd have to stay in Malta for 3 years to be able to apply for citizenship. However, if you're someone who would even consider investing €600k just for a passport, what's another €150k to speed it up by 2 years?\n\nIf you'd rather not drop several hundred Gs though (like most people), then read on.\n\n**3.) Ibero-American &amp; former colony citizens - 2 years (2 years of residency in Spain)**\n\nCitizens of former Spanish colonies + Brazil can acquire EU citizenship through Spain by moving to Spain for 2 years. The easiest way to get residency in Spain for 2 years is by getting a Digital Nomad Visa.\n\nThe countries/regions that qualify for this are:\n\n* Argentina\n* Bolivia\n* Brazil\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba\n* Dominican Republic\n* Ecuador\n* El Salvador\n* Equatorial Guinea\n* Guatemala\n* Honduras\n* Mexico\n* Nicaragua\n* Panama\n* Paraguay\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Puerto Rico\\*\n* Uruguay\n* Venezuela\n\n\\*Since Puerto Rico is not a country and Puerto Ricans are simply US citizens, they instead need to prove their Puerto Rican \"citizenship\" through a document called the \"Certificado de Nacionalidad Puertorriqueña\". This comes in handy for non Puerto Rican US citizens, see below.\n\n**4.) American citizens - 3 years (1 year of residency in Puerto Rico + 2 years of residency in Spain)**\n\nThe great thing about Puerto Rico being a part of the US is that this means non-Puerto Rican US citizens can also take advantage of the exemption made for Puerto Rico and acquire Spanish citizenship after only 1 year of residency in Puerto Rico to qualify for the certificate mentioned earlier.\n\nThen all they have to do is spend 2 years in Spain for a total of only 3 years needed to acquire EU citizenship. This is a great hack for American citizens looking to speed up their path to an EU passport.\n\n*Edit: if you're serious about trying this loophole, consult with a Spanish immigration lawyer first since there is conflicting information out there about the validity of this hack.*\n\n**5.) (Theoretical) Non-US citizens who can acquire residency in the US - 3 years (1 year of residency in Puerto Rico + potential tuition fees + 2 years of residency in Spain)**\n\nTheoretically, even non-American citizens could also take advantage of the Puerto Rico loophole by acquiring US residency first, spending a year in Puerto Rico, getting the certificate needed, and then moving to Spain for 2 years.\n\nI would imagine that a student visa for a Puerto Rican university would be the easiest visa type to obtain so if you're willing to go to school for a year, including paying the international student tuition fees for it for a year, then drop out and spend 2 years in Spain, you could potentially get your EU citizenship 2 years sooner than you'd otherwise normally be able to (see below).\n\nOf course, this is merely an idea. I don't know if Puerto Rican authorities will grant the \"citizenship\" certificate to non-US citizens on a student visa, it's quite possible they wouldn't, so YMMV here.\n\n*Edit: if you're serious about trying this loophole, consult with a Spanish immigration lawyer first since there is conflicting information out there about the validity of this hack.*\n\n**6.) Everyone else - 5 years (5 years of residency in Portugal)**\n\nFor everyone else, there are several different EU countries that allow you to apply for citizenship after 5 years of residency, but I highlight Portugal here since their Digital Nomad Visa can be extended for up to 5 years, meaning you could simply stay 5 years under that easy-to-get visa and then apply for citizenship.\n\nOther countries have 10 year residency requirements for citizenship (like Spain &amp; Italy), or only allow you to extend your DNV up to 2 or 3 years, or don't even offer a DNV to begin with, so Portugal is unique and more advantageous in this regard.\n\nSo if you're serious about acquiring EU citizenship and don't qualify for any of the previous methods mentioned, then this would be your best bet.\n\n**Anyway, this was fun for me to look into. Hopefully someone got some value out of it!**\n\n*Edit: there is some contention on the topic of the Puerto Rico loophole discussed in options 4 and 5. I am by no means an expert in this, I'm merely conveying information that I have found.*\n\n*Spanish immigration lawyers say that as long as you have the certificate mentioned here, it doesn't matter if you are actually Puerto Rican or not, you still qualify.*\n\n*At the same time though, the Civil Counsel in Spain says you need to have been born in Puerto Rico (or have parents born in Puerto Rico) to qualify, regardless of whether or not you have the certificate.*\n\n*However, it's arguably in the Civil Counsel of Spain's best interest to not promote loopholes like this one so they not be telling the whole truth. The only way to really find out is to try it yourself.*",

      "selftext": "I’m a Canadian woman in my 30’s currently working from Buenos Aires for the next few months. The purpose of this post isn’t to focus on the decisions that preceded my mugging, such as walking alone from La Boca to San Telmo at any time of day or the brand of shoes I was wearing. Rather, I aim to shed light on something often overlooked: our body's instinctive reaction to threats.\n\nFollowing my Airbnb host's suggestion, I walked from San Telmo to La Boca and spent a few hours there exploring. Around 12:30 pm, I decided to head back. After mapping out my route at a café and memorizing it to avoid having my phone out, I walked down a quiet residential block lined with small shops that would take me in the direction of San Telmo. Briefly distracted by a mother and daughter on the right side of the street, I suddenly noticed four men quickly approaching from the left. I locked eyes with the largest one, and his menacing look confirmed that I was in immediate danger.\n\nLogically, at 5'1\" and 110 pounds, I stood no chance against these guys. But logic was out the window. I turned my back to them, clutched my sling bag tight against my chest, and began to scream as they tackled me to the ground. I continued to scream and hold tight while they hit me and tried to cover my mouth. This lasted about 15 seconds until the realization that they could easily kill me finally overpowered the adrenaline coursing through my body, and I let go.\n\nI lost my iPhone, AirPods, Adidas Gazelles (yes, they even took my shoes), a credit card, and around $20 in pesos. My glasses were shattered, and I sustained minor cuts on my neck and arms. But my body's natural response to fight (resist) as opposed to fawn (give them what they want) went against everything I thought I'd do. The reality is, it’s impossible to predict how you will react in a similar situation, and easy to apply logic in hindsight.\n\nLike me, you may find yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time. Understanding your natural response to threats could be crucial in determining whether you defuse a threatening situation or unintentionally escalate it. The next time you hear a similar story, approach that person with compassion rather than judgment (victim blaming). Their resistance likely isn't driven by some flawed logic of protecting a phone; it’s an instinctive, primal fight for survival, regardless of the safety implications.\n\nHave you ever been in a situation where your instinctive response surprised you?\n\n**Edit**: Many comments have raised questions about my Airbnb host's involvement, and I can see how my initial wording might have given the wrong impression. To provide more context, I was at a cafe with my host on the morning of the incident. I mentioned feeling well enough to explore La Boca after being sick the entire previous week. I expressed a preference for walking since it was a nice day, and he suggested a route that included a park and a museum. I had planned to take an Uber back. Unfortunately, the incident occurred while I was attempting to walk back. It truly was a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.",

      "selftext": "What’s scary is that it was done by someone I’d known for 2–3 years. He played the long game.  Getting drugged is a risk I’ve always known exists, and I want to share it as a warning. I just never thought this person would.\n\nMe and my “friend” arrived in Medellin from Bogota, dropped our stuff at a place he lined up for us to “stay, and we started at a hookah bar in El Poblado.  We ended up in a local neighborhood in Antioquia. I’d only had a couple drinks by then and at some point, my “friend” and someone he clearly knew offered me what I thought was a blunt. I only drank water at Antioquia and didn’t have much of the blunt, and I think that saved me.\n\nOver time, instead of coming down, I got more dizzy and confused. I smoke regularly and knew this wasn’t normal. I’m aware of scopolamine, and once the confusion increased despite no alcohol, I knew what was happening.\n\nI called them out, and they started to talk very openly in Spanish about how they expected to rob me. They knew I speak decent Spanish and they still didn’t care. I was already hip to the plan even before they told me though. I let them get me into an Uber back to where we were staying (I ordered it so I knew where it was going), but on the ride home I deleted banking apps, contacted my emergency contact, and called both 123 and the U.S. Embassy emergency line. I made sure my “friend” knew authorities were involved.\n\nWhen we arrived, I refused to go inside, demanded my stuff, and stayed on the phone with the police. I told this guy to get my things and this would all go away. He got my stuff like I demanded, I grabbed my backpack with the meds I desperately needed, ordered another Uber, and went straight to a hotel.\n\nKnowing Spanish was huge here, and knowing what to do and staying calm in the moment is the only thing that saved me. The police did nothing and neither them or the clinic staff spoke any English, and the general vibe was basically: if you got drugged, it’s your fault.\n\nStay alert. Even people you think you know can surprise you. Have an action plan too so you can execute it even if you’re only half conscious.\n\nEdit: For anybody still tracking this post or who sees it later, apparently, you can put scopolamine in certain sections of a blunt and pass the blunt to the victim when it is most concentrated. So. To anybody saying, “they were smoking it too”, that’s your answer.\n\nSource: I’ve heard this from several people from who live here and are familiar with the practice. ",

      "selftext": "With **2.5 billion active users**, **Instagram** is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world.\n\nAnd **video** accounts for **over 80%** of its total traffic.\n\nWith those numbers, it's difficult to imagine how much **computation time and resources** it takes to upload, encode and publish videos from all those users.\n\nBut Instagram managed to reduce that time by 94% and also **improve their video quality**.\n\nHere's how.\n\n# The Process from Upload to Publish\n\nHere are the typical steps that take place whenever a user uploads a video on Instagram:\n\n1. **Pre-processing:** Enhance the video’s quality like color, sharpness, frame rate, etc.\n2. **Compression/Encoding:** Reduce the file size\n3. **Packaging:** Splitting it into smaller chunks for streaming\n\nFor this article, we will focus on the **encoding** and **packaging** steps.\n\n***Sidenote: Video Encoding***\n\n*If you were to record a 10-second 1080 video on your phone without any compression, it would be around* ***1.7 GB***.\n\n*That’s a lot!*\n\n*To make it smaller your phone uses something called a* ***codec***, that compresses the video for storage using ***efficient algorithms***.\n\n*So efficient that it will get the file size down to* ***35MB***, but it's in a format that not designed to be read by humans.\n\n*To watch the encoded video, a* ***codec*** *needs to decompress the file to pixels that can be displayed on your screen.*\n\n*The compression process is called* ***encoding***\\*, and the decompression process is called\\* ***decoding***.\n\n***Codecs*** *have improved over time so there are* [*many of them out there*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs#common_codecs)*. And they’re stored in most devices, cameras, phones, computers, etc.*\n\nInstagram generated **two types** of encodings on upload: **Advanced Encoding** (AV1), and **Simple** **Encoding** (H.264).\n\n[Screenshot of video from the original article](https://preview.redd.it/7etfqjqhzfhd1.jpg?width=772&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=70b1fadae1d662d54b5d1982670cde1dcfd67a1e)\n\n**Advanced encoding** produces videos that are small in size with **great quality.** These kind of videos only made up **15% of Instagram’s total watch time**.\n\n**Simple encoding** produces videos work on **older devices,** but used a **less efficient method of compression**, meaning the video are small with not great quality.\n\nTo make matters worse, simple encoding alone took up more than **80% of Instagram's computing resources**.\n\n# Why Simple Encoding Is Such a Resource Hog\n\nFor **Simple encoding**, a video is actually encoded in **two formats**:\n\n* **Adaptive bit rate (ABR)**: video quality will change based on the user's **connection speed.**\n* **Progressive**: video quality **stays the same** no matter the connection. This was for older versions of Instagram that **don't support ABR.**\n\nBoth **ABR** and **Progressive** created multiple encodings of the same video in different **resolutions and bit rates**.\n\nBut for **progressive**, the video player will only play one encoded video.\n\nWhile for **ABR** those videos are split into **small 2-10 second chunks**, and the video player will change which chunk is played based on the user’s internet speed.\n\n[It’s unknown how many videos were produced so 8 is a rough guess](https://preview.redd.it/lsuayeinzfhd1.png?width=5940&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d683a04ee913c7a1c49fccf7a49b48e60823e948)\n\n***Sidenote: Bit rate***\n\n*When a video is encoded, it stores binary data (1s and 0s) for each frame of the video, the more information each frame has, the higher its* ***bit rate***.\n\n*If I recorded a video of a still pond the* ***compression algorithm*** *will notice that most pixels stay blue, and store them with* ***less data*** *to keep the pixels the same.*\n\n*If I had a recording of a* ***fast-flowing waterfall*** *and the compression algorithm kept pixels the same, the video would look odd.*\n\n*Since pixels change a lot between frames it needs to* ***store more information*** *in each frame.*\n\n***Bit rate*** *is measured in* ***megabits per second (mbps)*** *since this is how much data is sent to the video player.*\n\n*On YouTube the average bitrate for a 1080 video is* ***8Mbps*** *which is* ***1Mb*** *of transmitted data every second.*\n\nIf you had to guess which specific process was taking up the most resources, you'd correctly guess **adaptive bit rate**.\n\nThis is not only due to creating multiple video files, but also because the additional **packaging step** involves **complex algorithms** to figure out how to **seamlessly switch between different video qualities**.\n\n# The Clever Fix\n\nUsually, progressive encoding creates just one video file. But because Instagram was **creating multiple files** with the same codec as ABR (H.264).\n\nThey realized they could use the **same files for progressive and ABR** eliminating the need to create two sets of the same videos.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o84508otzfhd1.png?width=4911&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3f6d4c6b3ffc89e7d24de1bb3b9ff1c38ea62fe\n\nIf you compare the image above to the previous image, you’ll see that **4 videos** are now created during the encoding stage **instead of 8**.\n\nThe team were able to use **the same progressive files** for the packaging stage of ABR which wasn’t as efficient as before resulting in **poorer compression**.\n\nBut they did save **a lot of resources**.\n\nInstagram claims the old ABR process took **86 seconds** for a **23-second video**.\n\nBut the **new** ABR process, just packaging, took **0.36 seconds**, which is a whopping **99% reduction** in processing time.\n\nWith this much reduction Instagram could dedicate more resources to the **advanced encoding process**, which meant more users could see **higher quality videos**. How?\n\nBecause simple encoding **took longer** in the old process and used **more resources**, there wasn’t enough to always create advanced videos.\n\nWith the new process, there was enough resource to run **both types of encoding**, meaning both can be published and more users would see **higher quality videos**.\n\nThis resulted in an increase in views of advanced encoded video **from 15% to 48%**.\n\n[Image from original article](https://preview.redd.it/zo9kjcqwzfhd1.jpg?width=1157&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=746017c9f57784ae541540cea7ef9e790c7ffcaa)\n\n***Sidenote: Encoding vs Transcoding***\n\n*This is an optional side note for the video experts among you.*\n\n*The word* ***transcoding*** *isn't used in this article, but technically it should have been.*\n\n***Encoding*** *is the process of compressing an uncompressed video into a smaller format.*\n\n***Transcoding*** *is the process of changing a video from one encoded format to the same, or another format.*\n\n*Because all devices (phones, cameras) have a* ***codec***\\*, when a video is recorded it is automatically encoded.\\*\n\n*So even before you upload a video to* ***Instagram*** *it is already encoded, and any further encoding is called* ***transcoding***.\n\n*But because the* [*original article*](https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/04/video-engineering/instagram-video-processing-encoding-reduction/) *mostly uses the term* ***encoding*** *and it’s is such a catch-all term used in the industry, I decided to stick with it.*\n\n# Wrapping Things Up\n\nAfter reading this you may be thinking, **how did the team not spot this obvious improvement?**\n\nWell, small issues on a small scale are often **overlooked**. Small issues on a large scale **no longer remain small issues**, and I guess that's what happened here.\n\nBesides, Instagram was always a **photo app** that is now focusing more on video, so I assume it's a learning process for them too.\n\nIf you want to read **more about their learnings,** check out the [Meta Engineering Blog](https://engineering.fb.com/tag/instagram/).\n\nBut if you enjoyed this **simplified version**, be sure to [subscribe](https://newsletter.betterstack.com/).",

      "title": "A tsunami is coming",
      "selftext": "TLDR: LLMs are a tsunami transforming software development from analysis to testing. Ride that wave or die in it.\n\nI have been in IT since 1969. I have seen this before. I’ve heard the scoffing, the sneers, the rolling eyes when something new comes along that threatens to upend the way we build software. It happened when compilers for COBOL, Fortran, and later C began replacing the laborious hand-coding of assembler. Some developers—myself included, in my younger days—would say, “This is for the lazy and the incompetent. Real programmers write everything by hand.” We sneered as a tsunami rolled in (high-level languages delivered at least a 3x developer productivity increase over assembler), and many drowned in it. The rest adapted and survived. There was a time when databases were dismissed in similar terms: “Why trust a slow, clunky system to manage data when I can craft perfect ISAM files by hand?” And yet the surge of database technology reshaped entire industries, sweeping aside those who refused to adapt. (See: Computer: A History of the Information Machine (Ceruzzi, 3rd ed.) for historical context on the evolution of programming practices.)\n\nNow, we face another tsunami: Large Language Models, or LLMs, that will trigger a fundamental shift in how we analyze, design, and implement software. LLMs can generate code, explain APIs, suggest architectures, and identify security flaws—tasks that once took battle-scarred developers hours or days. Are they perfect? Of course not. Just like the early compilers weren’t perfect. Just like the first relational databases (relational theory notwithstanding—see Codd, 1970), it took time to mature.\n\nPerfection isn’t required for a tsunami to destroy a city; only unstoppable force.\n\nThis new tsunami is about more than coding. It’s about transforming the entire software development lifecycle—from the earliest glimmers of requirements and design through the final lines of code. LLMs can help translate vague business requests into coherent user stories, refine them into rigorous specifications, and guide you through complex design patterns. When writing code, they can generate boilerplate faster than you can type, and when reviewing code, they can spot subtle issues you’d miss even after six hours on a caffeine drip.\n\nPerhaps you think your decade of training and expertise will protect you. You’ve survived waves before. But the hard truth is that each successive wave is more powerful, redefining not just your coding tasks but your entire conceptual framework for what it means to develop software. LLMs' productivity gains and competitive pressures are already luring managers, CTOs, and investors. They see the new wave as a way to build high-quality software 3x faster and 10x cheaper without having to deal with diva developers. It doesn’t matter if you dislike it—history doesn’t care. The old ways didn’t stop the shift from assembler to high-level languages, nor the rise of GUIs, nor the transition from mainframes to cloud computing. (For the mainframe-to-cloud shift and its social and economic impacts, see Marinescu, Cloud Computing: Theory and Practice, 3nd ed..)\n\nWe’ve been here before. The arrogance. The denial. The sense of superiority. The belief that “real developers” don’t need these newfangled tools.\n\nArrogance never stopped a tsunami. It only ensured you’d be found face-down after it passed.\n\nThis is a call to arms—my plea to you. Acknowledge that LLMs are not a passing fad. Recognize that their imperfections don’t negate their brute-force utility. Lean in, learn how to use them to augment your capabilities, harness them for analysis, design, testing, code generation, and refactoring. Prepare yourself to adapt or prepare to be swept away, fighting for scraps on the sidelines of a changed profession.\n\nI’ve seen it before. I’m telling you now: There’s a tsunami coming, you can hear a faint roar, and the water is already receding from the shoreline. You can ride the wave, or you can drown in it. Your choice.\n\n\n\nAddendum\n\nMy goal for this essay was to light a fire under complacent software developers. I used drama as a strategy. The essay was a collaboration between me, LibreOfice, Grammarly, and ChatGPT o1. I was the boss; they were the workers. One of the best things about being old (I'm 76) is you \"get comfortable in your own skin\" and don't need external validation. I don't want or need recognition.

The first thing you learn about unit testing is edge cases. That's not a \"behavior\" or \"interface\", that's an implementation detail.\n\nUnless the problem you're solving is so simple that you can see ahead of time how the code will look like, you'll inevitably refactor your code as you write it.

I have had the grief of maintaining a few projects that are taking years because of this pure agile mindset I feel.

However this is my first time really being the tech lead on a team since most of my work has been done solo or as just a non-lead member of a team. So I'm looking for opinions on whether I'm overreacting to something that one of my teammates keeps doing.\n\nI have a relatively newly hired mid-level dev on my team who regularly creates PRs into the develop branch with code that doesn't even compile. His excuse is that these are WIPs and he's just trying to get feedback from the team on it.\n\nMy opinion is that the intention of a PR is to submit code that is, as much as can be determined, production ready. A PR is no place to submit WIP.\n\nI'm curious as to what the consensus is? Is submitting WIP as a PR an abuse of the PR system? Or do people think it's okay to use the PR in order to get team feedback? To be fair, I can see how the PR *does* package up the diffs all nice and tidy in one place, so it's a tempting tool for that. But I'm wondering if there's a better way to go about this.\n\nGenuinely curious to hear how people fall on this.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for all of the quick feedback. It seems like a lot of people are okay with a PR having WIP as long as it's marked as a draft. I didn't realize this is a thing, and our source control (Bitbucket) *does* have this feature. So I will work with my guy to start marking his PRs as drafts if he wants to get feedback before submitting as a full-on PR. I think this is a great compromise.\n\nThanks all for the responses!",

      "selftext": "I am an embedded firmware engineer in a very small team of 3 developers. When I started 8 months ago, I added a pipeline job to require one other developer's approval before code can be merged. One developer, Bob really didn't like this as it was not his usual flow. \n\nRecently, Bob requested that I review his Merge Request as the other dev, Tom, was on vacation. Typically, Bob has Tom review his code changes, since, in Bob's own words, \"He's basically a rubber stamp\", but with Tom out he would need my approval.\n\n* On Tuesday after 5pm, he requested a review.\n* On Wednesday morning, I provided two pieces of input. \n\n1. \"Do we really need to force kill module A in this case? I think our process monitor will handle it already.\"\n2. \"The .gitmodules change looks accidental\"\n\nTo my surprise, Bob implemented comment 1 and fixed comment 2.\n\n* On Friday at 4pm, Bob notified me that it was again ready for review, but that it was still building (our pipeline builds currently take 2 hours)\n* At 4:30, I left 1 comment\n\n**Me**: \"So I'm looking through the code on your MR. Can we reduce the level of indentation here. When it gets to about 4 or 5 levels of indentation it becomes unmanageable. I understand a lot of our codebase has an insane amount of indentation but I have never seen 14 levels of indentation.\"\n\n**Bob**: \"It works. I could split it out as a function, but doesn't seem worth it as this point. That will cause another half-day delay.\"\n\n**Me**: \"I know our code base is not that clean, but I want to create a more readable codebase and I believe that we can do better than this.\nUnfortunately, code is read way more than it is written and I don't feel comfortable merging this until the readability is improved.\"\n\n**Bob**: \"I disagree. The functionality is clear. In my opinion, it is not your job as a reviewer to critique coding style. It is to confirm there are no errors. The goal is to have functional code. It has been thoroughly tested. To make any major changes at this point, without any changes in functionality will result in excessive delays in releasing this.\"\n\n**Me**: \"As a reviewer, my responsibility is not just to confirm the absence of errors but also to ensure that the code is readable and maintainable.\nI understand your concerns about the delay, but investing the time now in readability can save us a lot of time and effort in the long run. This code will live on in currentRevision, eventually currentRevisionV2, and we can fix it later, but it will be easier and quicker to solve it now.\"\n\n* At this point it’s 5:00pm so I log off\n\n\n**Bob**: \"I disagree.”\n\n**30 minutes elapse**\n\n**Bob**: \"It's also your responsibility to work amicably with your coworkers\"\n\nAt this point, it’s 6:00pm and as I’m cooking dinner, I’m trying to figure out how to resolve this so I decide to straight out ask Bob what I have done that is bothering him so much. I’m somewhat second guessing myself. Maybe, I am being too dictatorial, on simple style issues, but where do you draw the line? In my opinion, merging in code with 14 levels of indentation is not a simple style issue, it is like planting a landmine in the codebase. If this code causes issues in the future, I will feel partially responsible if I just approve it. I feel like Bob is trying to strongarm me into just shipping it. I'm wondering if this is a hill worth dying on.\n\nI have had a similar argument in the past during a code review when Bob wanted to merge in Dead Zombie Code (code that had been functionally removed, but was just commented out). He didn’t want to completely remove it in case we needed it later and he didn’t trust our version control to bring it back if we wanted to. Eventually, he gave in to my protests and removed that commented out code. In that case, to him, it was style semantics, to me it was fundamentally wrong.\n\nUnfortunately these days, I spend a good chunk of my time resolving old bugs introduced by Bob and refactoring unreadable code written by Bob. But for every 25 lines I fix, Bob introduces 200 new lines with the same old issues. Things like, copy pasting code instead of breaking it out into a function, dereferencing objects without checking if they're Null, adding log statements at INFO level that should really be at TRACE level. When he says that his code is tested, there is no test report or unit tests, it's really just a \"Trust me Bro, it worked on my machine\". So, it feels like all my efforts are quickly wiped out by Bob.\n\nStrangely, I never have these issues with Tom. So I don't think my code reviews are exceptionally harsh. In fact, my bar for approval is simply don't make things worse. Tom just writes better code.\n\nWith all this in mind I asked Bob,\n\n**Me**: \"What about my behavior has been unamicable?\"\n\n**Bob**: \"You're not listening to what I have to say and you seem to be dictating changes. That is not the role of a reviewer, in my opinion. This whole interaction is very off-putting. \n\n**30 minutes elapse**\n\n**Bob**: \"Look, you're a very smart guy, and I do appreciate your input. But that's what it is... input. If what you have to say sounds reasonable, I will make the changes. But I can't have you dictating changes. That's not your job as a reviewer.\"\n\n**30 minutes elapse**\n\n**Bob**: \"Transferred MR to Tom\"\n\nNow, after all this strife, the code will simply be rubber stamped by Tom when he returns to work on Monday. \n\nI do not want to be dictating semantic style changes, but it is unclear to me where the line is for this style is so bad it may as well be a mistake. \nIn the code there was a couple lines like,\n\n    if conditionA or conditionB:\n        if conditionA:  \n            #doSomething  \n\nThat is just insanely wrong to me and lazy.\nTo Bob, it works.\n\n* Sunday at Noon (I have not said anything to Bob since Friday when I asked \"What about my behavior has been unamicable?\")\n\n* **Bob**: \"After some reflection, this interchange was very upsetting and humiliating. I don't care to go through that again. Probably not use you for code reviews in the future.\"\n\nSo\n\n* AITA for stalemating this code review?\n* What should I do come Monday?\n* Should I bring in Tom, line managers, or HR to have a discussion?\n\nEDIT: We currently do not have a linter in the pipeline or a style guide.\n\nThe code in question looked like\n\n    if\n        if\n            if\n                if\n                    if\n                        if\n                            if\n                                if\n                                    if\n                                        if\n                                            if\n                                                if\n                                                    if\n                                                        if\n                                                            if\n                                                                hisCodeHere\n\nEDIT2:\n\n* The language is python.\n* Bob has been in his role for at least 6 years. He would be considered a senior.\n\nBob has sent out the following email,\n\nHi lineManager and productManager,\n&gt; I would like to be clear on what the job of a merge reviewer is. My understanding is that it is to catch any problems in logic or errors in coding. DarkMarker is refusing to approve my merge because he doesn't like my indentation. This is a style issue. This has been thoroughly tested code. To do what he wants will result in at least a day if not more delay... not just the coding change but all facets of testing. Please advise me on how I should proceed. I'm very unhappy on how this code review has been handled. This isn't the only one. I will prefer Tom going forward.\nThanks\nBob\n\n\nEDIT3: \n\nTo be clear there were 10 levels of nested conditionals already existing in the code snippet. \n\nBob added 4 new nested conditionals.\n\nThere are no unit tests, there is no test report, there are no logs from a manual test. \n\nI made a mistake of not bundling all my review into the first code review. I didn’t catch the nesting on the first go around because gitlab diffs default to side by side. This hides the level of nesting. On the second code review, I checked out his branch and noticed the insane level of nesting. I should have done that the first review. \n\nThis sprint there is already a task to implement SonarQube. \n\nOur unit test pipeline job has 6 unit tests. \n\nI agree, a MR is probably not the place to start enforcing this kind of thing. I think approval + refactor ticket + a comment about this level of nesting is probably a better path\n\nEDIT 4: I appreciate all the feedback and will definitely apply it going forward. \n\nThe update for those who were wondering is below. \n\n* Tom merged Bob’s MR on Monday. \n* Bob skipped stand up on Monday Morning. \n* Line Manager is Out of the Office this week on work travel. \n* Line manager requested via email to see how bad the code was after receiving the email from Bob. I sent him the code snippets along side my concerns and mistakes I think I made in discussing with Bob (failure to communicate it is not a style issue but a nesting complexity issue, failure to do a thorough MR first code review, missing the opportunity to approve with a comment and a debt ticket.\n* Line manager said he would discuss it with Bob.\n* Bob sent me a rude message on Monday night at 10:00pm belittling a major feature I implemented 2 months ago. I have not talked to him since Friday. \n\nThe larger context of the post that I have intentionally left out (because I want to improve my soft skills and ability to work with Bob) is that management finds Bob difficult and does not like working with him. \n\nThey are aware that Bob generates a ton of bugs, bad code, and often misremembers how our product works. Bob has released multiple production breaking bugs in the last few months. Bugs that break core features of our product. \nBob is just as argumentative and defensive when these critical bugs are found in the field. He says they are not replicatable, even when the replication steps are \n\n1. Use the product as is expected.\n\nSince he is so difficult to deal with and basically will not acknowledge the bug’s existence, management will have me root cause and resolve the issue. Bob ends up sheltered away and does not have to experience the consequences of his buggy code. \n\nThey are also aware that our developer flow needs improvement and are actively prioritizing these things in the backlog and into sprints (Reducing build time, Linter in Pipeline, automated integration tests on live hardware, etc).\n\nSo long story short, things are quiet right now, but I would say I have management in my corner.",

      "selftext": "**MODS - I DO NOT WORK AT ANY OF THESE COMPANIES. THIS IS A HELPFUL POST - NOT PROMOTIONAL**\n\nI run a digital marketing agency and have worked in b2b marketing for 15 years. I've been an individual contributor, Director, VP, and now a CEO. Throughout my career, I've used pretty much every saas tool you can think of. I just started using reddit for business, so I figured I'd put together a list of my favorites with the hope it helps you at some point. My gift as a newbie.  \n\n\n**Hubspot**: You can't beat the best. Hands down the best marketing automation platform and overall \"source of information\" for any marketing team. I've used Pardot, Marketo, and Act On and Hubspot is by far the best. It's a big expense, so I recommend teams that just need email marketing to go to the next tool on my list.  \n\n\n**Apollo.io:** Combine Zoominfo with Salesloft and you have Apollo. I think it's still $99/month for unlimited email credits from the contact database. It's a great email marketing tool. Has all the functionality of other sales engagement tools at a fraction of the price.  \n\n\n**Gong.io:** I know Gong is mostly a sales tool but I've used it for voice of customer research. As good as I think I am writing copy, nothing is better than taking the words right out of the customer's mouth. Much of my best content and highest-performing landing pages all started with a Gong recording.  \n\n\n**Winware.ai**: Winware is my new favorite for on-site lead capture. I've used modals, newsletter signups, and demo forms to generate leads from my content and never got above a 1% conversion rate. Winware offers visitors an incentive for providing feedback on a blog post but requires them to provide their business email address first. It's the best lead hook on my website.  \n\n\n**Session Rewind**: Think HotJar but better. I use Session Rewind to watch videos of people on my landing page. You can tell I like to have a solid mix of quant and qual data. Google Analytics can't tell me exactly what people do on my site.  \n\n\n**BigMarker**: I just started using this one for webinars and I've been really impressed. It's expensive. Way more than GotoWebinar or Zoom Webinars but I like that it's a dedicated tool and not part of a suite of products.  \n\n\n**Unsplash**: Best and cheapest stock image library I've found. I signed up for a premium account for $50/year I think and use it every time I need stock images for ads and landing pages.  \n\n\n**ChatGPT 4**: Obvious one, but seriously, if you aren't using ChatGPT 4 - NOT GPT 3 - you're behind the curve. Half of the marketers I know are using this to write all their content now. It's not perfect by any stretch but it's a must use in any marketer's toolkit. AI is going to take our jobs sooner than later anyway. Might as well lean into it.  \n\n\n**ClickUp**: My favorite project management tool. It's so much better than Monday.com. I run my entire company through ClickUp and I'm still on the free plan. Great integrations and so easy to use. I was a Monday user for a long time but the switch was worth it.  \n\n\n**Ahrefs**: I know there's a Semrush v Ahrefs debate but I'm firmly on the side of Ahrefs. It's the best tool I've used for SEO. Gives me all the information I need on my site and competitors. I have an entire SEO toolkit that I'll save for another time, but Ahrefs is a great start.  \n\n\nI tried to mix in some known and lesser-known tools in there. Hopefully, it can help some of my fellow marketers.",

Yeah, he thought the \"meta\" in meta descriptions was referring to Meta (as in Facebook/Instagram). 🙃\n\n\n\nThere were several more suggestions that left me scratching my head, but if I listed them all, this post would get way too long.\n\n\n\nWhat do you all think?

      "selftext": "The quality of your resume matters. I am the director of digital marketing, marketing analytics, and marketing operations for a mid-size company. I hire a hand-full of people every year and go through literally thousands of resumes per position. Our positions are fully remote and potential candidates can be anywhere in the US or Canada so we received a lot of applicants. The current digital marketing manager role I am hiring pays up to $155K and I have received 2172 resumes for the position. Of those, I have moved 13 candidates through to my hiring manager for an initial phone interview.\n\nFor context, for those familiar with it, we use Greenhouse as our HR platform. I open and look at every single resume that comes through. I can tell in about 10 seconds if someone is a hard pass for me. It doesn't mean that they might not be qualified, it just means the resume is so underwhelming that I am moving on to the next one. \n\nI understand this is my personal perspective and others will vary. That said, here is what I am looking for:\n\n* Your resume needs to stand out! I am hiring for marketing positions. If you cannot market yourself, how can I trust you managing a $5m budget?\n* If you are not good at building a resume, go to Etsy and pay $20 for a well designed resume that is aesthetically pleasing and is formatted in a way that you can highlight your experience.\n* I know not everyone agrees but use (some) color in your resume. When I am going through 30 resumes and I am getting hit with all black text only brick of text resumes one after another, they rarely catch my eye. Even better, match the color scheme (or color) to include the company's color pallet. It's a subconscious trick that will resonate with people who review a lot of resumes.\n* Keep it under 2 pages. I don't care how much experience you have, I am only looking at your last couple of positions as my focus.\n* Do not highlight your freelance experience as the focus of your resume. Since I am hiring a fully remote role, I will be concerned that you are going to be working two gigs if your resume focus is freelance work. You can include it, but don't make that a focus of your work history.\n* Absolutely list all of the platforms and tools that you have experience with. I always look at those when they are listed. If you list Google Ads, Meta Ads, Bing Ads, Marketo, Salesforce, Tableau, SEMRush, and other platforms that we use, I am going to give your resume more attention.\n* Do the small things. If I am hiring for a digital marketing manager position, indicate that you are looking for a digital marketing manager role. Don't say you are a \"digital expert\" or that you are seeking a \"senior digital role\". I want someone who identifies as seeking the role for which I am hiring.\n* If you include a cover letter, make sure it is personalized for the company and written specifically to communicate why this particular role is interesting to you and why our company seems like a good fit for you. If you are sending generic cover letters, you might as well not send it.\n* Imbed a link to your LinkedIn profile. Imbed a link to your portfolio if you have one. It's a small thing but I am more likely to look at them if I don't have to copy and paste links into my browser.\n* Lastly, for the love of all that is holy, do not write your resume or cover letter in third person. I will immediately think you are a narcissistic lunatic and hit the reject button without reading another word.\n\nHopefully this is helpful for someone. I go through a lot of resumes and most of of them are bad. If you are sending out dozens (or hundreds) of resumes and not getting any hits, change your resume. It can be as simple as downloading a resume from Etsy and sending something out with a little character. Market yourself. Happy hunting!",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'm an ex-Meta engineer who spent 5+ years working on the ads algorithm team. And then I worked at Reddit as a Senior Engineer in their ads department as well.\n\nEdit: After leaving, I founded [Aimerce](http://aimerce.ai) to help Shopify brands fix the exact tracking and delivery issues I saw from the inside and honestly, it’s wild how many of the same patterns still show up.\n\nBased on my experience helping 120+ brands since leaving Meta, here's what actually works:\n\nI won't dive into details about idea validation or market fit—that should come before product creation. But if you already have a product in commerce or B2B, here's some underrated solutions to try to boost your rev:\n\n**Optimization**  \nFrom my time building Meta's ad delivery system, I know this is crucial. Your website needs perfect technical implementation or you're throwing money away. Key technical elements that feed into ad algorithms:\n\n* Server-side API integration (crucial since iOS 14)\n* First-party cookie implementation\n* Advanced matching parameters\n* Custom conversion events\n* Real-time event logging\n\nMost importantly: track every meaningful user interaction server-side. At Meta, we saw 3-4x better ad performance with proper server events vs client-side only.\n\n**First-Party Data Collection**  \nThis is what powers modern ad algorithms. Essential data points to collect:\n\n* User behavior patterns\n* Conversion paths\n* Time-to-conversion\n* Cart abandonment signals\n* Feature usage metrics\n\nPro tip: Log these events immediately server-side. There's a 30% data loss on average with client-side only. This means having your own first party data pixel or first party intelligence app instead of relying on third party pixels like the default you get from Meta, Google, or whatever ad platform you're using.\n\n**Algorithm Optimization**  \nHaving built these systems, here's what actually matters:\n\n* Event quality scores. These are more accurate when tracked server-side instead of a third party pixel.\n* Server-side conversion matching\n* Bidding strategy alignment\n* Creative performance signals. This one is most obvious.\n\nThe algorithm weighs server-sent signals 2-3x more than pixel data.\n\n**Email Engagement**  \nI'm a huge advocate of having a combination of paid and email marketing. When they work in tandem, you get the highest quality signals that can feed into each other for retargeting. Here's some flow that people usually miss:\n\n* abandoned cart for ecommerce\n* abandoned intent for b2b\n\nNote that abandoned cart/intent are explicitly different from abandoned checkout. At the checkout stage, you've already collected email address and have high-intent for conversion. Email marketing is going to be even more effective at the stage right before. For ecommerce, its going to be at the point of adding the cart. For B2B, it could be viewing the pricing page.\n\nMost people don't implement these flows because it often requires some manual work but if you're able to stitch user sessions across their history, you can use your cookies to understand if the visitor has shown interest in purchasing before and have a specific email flow for it! This is probably the most underrated solutions.\n\nPro Tip: Sync email engagement data back to ad platforms via server events. This improves targeting by 25-30%.\n\nThe key is quality first-party data feeding into platforms' algorithms. With proper implementation, I regularly see 2-3x ROAS improvement.\n\nWe’re seeing the same delivery issues pop up again and again especially in accounts using duplicated pixel setups or relying too heavily on GTM. At Aimerce, I've audited hundreds of Shopify brands this year alone, and it’s always the same root causes. Fix those and performance usually rebounds.\n\nMessage me if you need help with technical implementation details! I might do a dedicated post on this if there's interest!a",

      "selftext": "Good day Redditors.\r  \n\r  \nI have written posts about how we approach advertising to drive success for our clients and our brands.\r  \n\r  \nThis post will be about a summary of learnings from spending over $20M in ad spend.\r  \n\r  \nI know it's not that much ad spend, there are people who manage this a month.\r  \n\r  \nTo be quite fair, 60% of the ad spending has come from this year.\r  \n\r  \nSo, let's start.\r  \n\r  \nI remember the early days of advertising in Meta. Back in 2018, literally anyone who had a somewhat decent product where able to generate sales.\r  \n\r  \nWhat was even more fun was that It was done with quite a few ads.\r  \n\r  \nThen all of the advertising was about \"hacking the ads manager\"\r  \n\r  \nTesting interests\r  \n\r  \nCreating lookalikes from followers, website visitors, purchases, email lists, etc.\r  \n\r  \nBack in 2018, we were able to scale a bike company brand from $20k a month to $240k a month in just 10 months.\r  \n\r  \nWe found one ad, and we tried to spend as much money as possible with that ad doing all sorts of \"hacking ads manager\" stuff.\r  \n\r  \nThis was the year when we decided to launch sales on Halloween and generated $100k in just a few days.\r  \n\r  \nOur black friday that year didn't even come close.\r  \n\r  \nFast forward to 2020.\r  \n\r  \nThis was still before IOS, I noticed that it was tough to replicate the scaling with just one ad.\r  \n\r  \nIn 2020 we started to test new ads every month, I remember this vividly.\r  \n\r  \nCreated 3 ads for that month that we wanted to test, and we hit two winners.\r  \n\r  \nOne video, one image.\r  \n\r  \nWow... So that became our benchmark, test 2 new ads every month and still do \"hacking the ads manager\" trying to push these ads via interests, lookalikes, and duplicating campaigns from abo to CBO, to CBO from abo.\r  \n\r  \nThat time literally, our team spent at least 2 hours per day in Facebook ads manager trying to figure out the newest targeting hacks by using stacking.\r  \n\r  \nWe played around with interests stacks and lookalikes stacks.\r  \n\r  \nEven combo stacks. We really thought that this is what generates the best results.\r  \n\r  \nThen....\r  \n\r  \nArmageddon happened.\r  \n\r  \nIOS 14 Mother\\*\\*\\*er.\r  \n\r  \nThis update wiped our performance across all accounts like no other.\r  \n\r  \nWe thought that this was the extinction of Facebook ads.\r  \n\r  \nEveryone was screaming Facebook ads are dead.\r  \n\r  \nClients were dropping us left and right.\r  \n\r  \nThen after a month of horrible performance and losing clients, we still had to pay our people.\r  \n\r  \nWe understand that \"Hacking Facebook ads manager\" days have come to an end.\r  \n\r  \nWe started to test fewer interests but still kept the lookalikes. :D\r  \n\r  \nThis was the time when we started to test more ads - 4 a month.\r  \n\r  \nYes, we doubled the testing.\r  \n\r  \nIt's actually funny to look back, thinking that testing 4 ads a month was actual testing.\r  \n\r  \nWe are at the end of 2021.\r  \n\r  \nTesting about 8 new ads every month for our brand and our clients.\r  \n\r  \nMainly using a stack of interests and a stack of lookalikes.\r  \n\r  \nNow it's January 2022, we signed this one client with the capacity to create ads and we were also building our in-house content department in order to scale creative testing.\r  \n\r  \nWe analyzed:\r  \n\r  \nFacebook and Instagram content - what type of content are we seeing daily?\r  \n\r  \nTurns out we were seeing content that we were interested in.\r  \n\r  \nFacebook and Instagram ads - again, most of the ads that were shown to us and that we reacted to were the stuff that we were interested in.\r  \n\r  \nInteresting...\r  \n\r  \nThis is still January 2022.\r  \n\r  \nWhat if we start researching customer psychology and customer behavior and just understand what type of content our target customer likes to see? ( I Have a post on how we approach research, so I won't describe this in detail in this post).\r  \n\r  \nLet's create ads that speak to our target customers by introducing awareness stages\r  \n\r  \nUnaware ads - ads that take an unaware audience to most aware audience.\r  \n\r  \nProblem-aware - ads that talk to people who know about their problem.\r  \n\r  \nSolution-aware ads - ads that target people who understand that they have a problem but don't know which solution to choose.\r  \n\r  \nProduct aware - ads that target people who understand their problem and also know how that is the way on how to solve their problem but don't know which brand/product to choose.\r  \n\r  \nMost aware - people who already know everything about their problem, how to solve it, what product to choose, they are just waiting for the right time to buy from you.\r  \n\r  \nSo how can we test the content?\r  \n\r  \nOne thing is creating the ads another is testing it.\r  \n\r  \nWe had this complicated ad account structure, one campaign ABO campaign to test audiences, and one CBO for scaling the best audiences with the best ads.\r  \n\r  \nWe aimed to create 20 ads.\r  \n\r  \nThere was no way we could test 20 ads and interests on the ABO level, this was like lighting money on fire.\r  \n\r  \nThen we decided to use:\r  \n\r  \nOne CBO campaign.\r  \n\r  \nUse best-performing interests and lookalike combo stack and one broad ad set ( no targeting)\r  \n\r  \nTo test how the ads messages work.\r  \n\r  \nWhy no targeting?\r  \n\r  \nWell, by doing content analysis, we were interested in testing the theory of is the algorithm capable of delivering our ads to the right customer without us doing the targeting side.\r  \n\r  \nWe launched 3 video ads that were talking about the customer problem and educating how this product will solve it.\r  \n\r  \nOn day one, we are getting sales with interest and the lookalike combo stack is winning.\r  \n\r  \nDay two combo stack still winning by a lot.\r  \n\r  \nOn day three, our broad ad set was picking up more and more sales.\r  \n\r  \nDay four, our broad ad set, took 80% of that day's spend, leaving the combo stack in the dust.\r  \n\r  \nDay 5, our combo stack dot us one sale.\r  \n\r  \nDay 6, we turned off our combo stack and started creating new broad ad sets with new ad tests.\r  \n\r  \nIt took off.\r  \n\r  \nWe immediately did this for all of our accounts.\r  \n\r  \nSame result.\r  \n\r  \nImagine spending 4 years \"hacking the ads manager\" and seeing that no targeting is producing better results for niche markets than targeting.\r  \n\r  \nThat was a real eye-opener on what Facebook ads algorithm can do.\r  \n\r  \nSince January 2022, we have been spending more and more time researching and developing the ads than the actual Facebook ad account.\r  \n\r  \nWe have measured that, on average, we spend up to 10 minutes a day optimizing the accounts, and 2-3 hours are spent on researching and analyzing the data to create a better ad.\r  \n\r  \nOne of our first steps is to test 50-100 ads in the first month to understand what messaging hits.\r  \n\r  \nBy doing this, we are able to find winning messages really fast.\r  \n\r  \nWhat previously took 6-12 months now can be done in 1-3 months\r  \n\r  \nTesting a lot of ad messages provides you with a lot of winners.\r  \n\r  \nThen creating at least 10 variations on winning ads, you can come down to 1-3 messages that spend 60-80% of your daily budget, which you can comfortably scale.\r  \n\r  \nToday.\r  \n\r  \nIf you say that ad testing does not work. You clearly haven't spent enough time researching and testing multiple ad variations.\r  \n\r  \nThe algorithm has become more and more content-oriented.\r  \n\r  \nThis is the reason we are not experiencing shit days with meta like most of brands and advertisers do.\r  \n\r  \nYes, we have a few a month, but it's nowhere near the amount that I read on this Reddit channel.\r  \n\r  \nSo, to sum up what it takes to generate good results with Facebook ads.\r  \n\r  \nDaily research 1-3 hours.\r  \n\r  \nDaily ad creation 1-2 hours.\r  \n\r  \nDaily ad optimization of 5-10 minutes.\r  \n\r  \nAds is the targeting.\r  \n\r  \nUnderstanding your customers is by far the most important thing in order to create ads that they will react to.\r  \n\r  \nContent is king - that's why it's important to input hours and hours into content creation.\r  \n\r  \nFacebook is not rewarding mediocre input anymore.\r  \n\r  \nTop brands are still scaling.\r  \n\r  \nYou can do this too.\r  \n\r  \nKeep in mind this is just about Facebook ads, I'm not talking about what happens after the click, your website, your business numbers, upsells, crossells, email flows.\r  \n\r  \nSometimes I like to think about Facebook ads as salespeople.\r  \n\r  \nWe know that big businesses have whole sales departments generating sales every minute.\r  \n\r  \nIf you only rely on one salesperson, it's going to get burnt our calling the phone 24/7.\r  \n\r  \nThe same thought process can be applied to meta.\r  \n\r  \nThe more salespeople you have out here calling the phone, and knocking on doors, the more sales you are going to get.\r  \n\r  \nFind the right salespeople.\r  \n\r  \nThanks for reading.",

Here’s my honest take so far:  \n**It’s worth it. It’s messy. It’s freeing. It’s terrifying. And I’d do it again.**\n\nIf anyone’s on the same path — let’s share notes.\n\nHere’s to more of us choosing to bet on ourselves. 🚀",

      "title": "Facebook stopped caring about your targeting two years ago and nobody told you",
      "selftext": "I've been running ads for brands doing 100K to 300K per day and the thing that blows my mind is how many people are still out here selecting interests like it's 2019.\n\nFacebook hasn't updated their interest database in forever. All those detailed targeting options you think are precise? Half those audiences are dead engagement. People who liked a page six years ago and never opened Facebook again. And Facebook has been quietly removing targeting options for months now because they know it doesn't work anymore.\n\nThe shift everyone missed is this: Facebook went all in on AI. Their whole pitch now is \"trust the pixel, let us find your people.\" That's why Advantage Shopping campaigns exist. It's not some optional feature to test, it's the entire direction of the platform.\n\n**Here's what actually works now.**\n\nYou consolidate. Instead of running 10 campaigns with fragmented data, you run 2 or 3 and feed the pixel way more information per campaign. Broad targeting, just age and gender, and let the algorithm do the rest.\n\nI know what you're thinking. \"I tried broad and it sucked.\" Yeah, because your creative sucked.\n\nWhen you remove interest targeting, your ad has to do all the work. If your hook is generic, if your angle could apply to anyone, the algorithm has no idea who to show it to. But if your ad says \"just got out of the shower and your knee is throbbing from that tennis match last week\"—that level of specific—Facebook knows exactly who that person is.\n\n**The marketing fundamental nobody teaches.**\n\nEugene Schwartz had this framework called the Five Stages of Awareness. It goes from Unaware (don't know they have a problem) to Most Aware (know your product, just need the offer). Most people making ads have no idea where their customer sits on that spectrum.\n\nA problem aware ad looks like: \"Do you have back pain? Most Americans suffer from it and never address it until it becomes chronic.\" You're calling out the pain, agitating it, then presenting the solution.\n\nA solution aware ad is more direct: \"Hate doing dishes? Get these gloves.\" They already know the problem and want the fix.\n\nProduct aware is comparison mode: \"Other humidifiers do this wrong, ours fixed it.\" You're positioning against known alternatives.\n\nIf you can't articulate which stage you're targeting, your messaging will be confused. And confused ads don't convert, no matter how much budget you throw at them.\n\n**The research nobody wants to do.**\n\nGo to Amazon. Find similar products. Use a tool like Shulex to analyze reviews. Look at what people actually complain about. \"Poor suction\" shows up 50 times? Cool, now your ad says \"superior suction, sticks anywhere.\"\n\nGo to YouTube and TikTok. Watch videos in your niche. Read the comments. Someone says \"do you have to clean this thing constantly?\" Great, now you have an angle: \"Tired of cleaning your humidifier twice a week? Ours takes 30 seconds.\"\n\nWhen you understand your customer better than they understand themselves, you don't need interest targeting. The ad finds them because it speaks directly to their brain.\n\nMost people lose because they're copying big brands. If you copy a McDonald's style ad for your unknown burger joint, why would anyone choose you over McDonald's? You're not established. You need to leverage what makes you different, not what makes you similar.\n\nThe boring truth is this: research equals money. You can't hack your way around knowing your customer. Write down your learnings, track what works, iterate on winners. Test three variations of every concept so you're not wasting money on a single bad hook.\n\nIf your ads feel like they're talking to everyone, they're talking to nobody. Get specific, go broad on targeting, and let Facebook's AI do what it's actually good at now.",

      "title": "How We Organically Scaled an Ecommerce Jewelry Brand To Give $180,000 ROI Within 8 Months",
      "selftext": "Hello Redditors! I wanted to share with you guys another amazing organic growth success story. I really like sharing our organic growth achievements because I often see business owners and digital marketers getting very demotivated from all the high competition negativity in the market so I hope this post will be informative and motivating for a lot of  you who are facing the same situation.\n\n**The Client:** Jewelry Ecommerce Brand \n\n**Revenue Split Between SEO and Social Media:** 9:1\n\n**Average Order Value:** $3000\n\n**Total Revenue(6 months):** $330,000\n\n**Expenses(6 months):** Product Cost + Delivery cost + Team + Agency Fees + Packaging + Additional Costs: $150,000\n\n**Basic Business Background:**\n\nThis case study is about a family owned jewelry business that has been running for the past 15 years. Initially it was just a physical jewelry store that was being run by a middle aged couple who designed their own jewelry. The store was doing fine before covid but since past 3-4 years their sales started plummeting. Someone suggested to them that they should start selling products online under their brand name. So they contacted a local agency who developed their website and they worked on SEO and were running ads for them.\n\nAfter a few months when they did not get any results whatsoever with SEO and below average results with Ads, one of their relatives, for whom we were doing lead generation for their real estate business, referred the couple to us. The couple asked us to keep the spendings to a minimum because they had spent a lot on ads and previous agency fees. So we did some research and assured them that we can get them results by just organic marketing and later we can start running ads from the revenue that they generate from this if they like. Since they also have a physical store so we suggested optimizing their Google My Business Profile as well but they wanted us to focus on the website specifically and develop this as an ecommerce brand.\n\n**SEO Strategy** \n\nFor the initial months we started with just SEO and we weren’t really considering social media as a huge option. There are several categories when it comes to jewelry, so basically they had a huge website with several categories and subcategories like earrings, necklaces, rings, engagement rings, etc. So, it was crucial to do proper research and identify which category holds the best potential since our primary aim was to recover the owner’s previous losses and strengthen their budget. \n\nAlthough this is a very competitive business, after researching each and every category and sub category, we found that engagement rings can be a really good starting point. We generated a traffic of around 18k and 1.5 million impressions in the first 8 months on the website. Some keywords in this category had a really low KD with decent traffic and other keywords had KD’s on a slightly higher side but the volume was really good. So overall it is a really balanced category to start with for SEO.\n\nOnce we decided on the category, we audited the website for technical issues and if the website has a proper structure. For a successful SEO project, a proper website structure, good UI/UX and high quality content are extremely important pillars. \n\nAfter our technical audit, we found that several pages were missing H1 headings, several subcategories that had really good potential did not have separate pages and some spammy backlinks were made in the past 2-3 months. There were other technical issues as well but these were the major ones. So first of all our developer optimized the website properly.\n\nWe started with one sub category page at a time under the engagement rings category. Initially we targeted sub categories with lowest KD. We optimized urls for the collection pages, added content to the pages with proper keyword integration, optimized titles and meta descriptions.\n\nFor writing good and properly structured on page content, always research the top 5 ranking websites for your primary keyword. This will give you an idea about the keyword density, content structure and content length. You can also make UI/UX changes after looking at these websites. \n\nYour aim should be to post more informative content as compared to the websites that are already ranking on the top. \n\nWe optimized 6-8 collection pages per month and were posting around 4 blogs per month. We kept the number of blogs low as we felt there is enough potential in ranking for commercial keywords itself which can get us more conversion as compared to blogs. \n\nAlthough initially we thought that we might be making some paid backlinks once the business starts generating some revenue, but till now we have just stuck to making unpaid ones because we are getting good results for low KD keywords without making this extra investment. \n\nThis is a very important tip that I have included in my previous posts as well. Many people feel that since the starting of their SEO project, they need to make paid backlinks. The most important part is to do proper research, if your KD is low, your UI/UX is good and your content is well structured, you can easily rank with unpaid backlinks as well. Overall good SEO results depend on following a well planned strategy and doing deep research. So the above method might not work if you are going for a high competition keyword, but in that case you need to form a different strategy and things will work out.’\n\nFor making no follow unpaid backlinks, we use forums and websites like vocal media, medium, pinterest, postimages, scribd, pdfslide, etc. Apart from this, we set up dummy blogs on websites like wordpress, wix, tumblr, blogger, etc and posting content on these dummy blogs gives us do-follow backlinks. We also make search consoles for these websites, so most of our backlinks get indexed as well. We have used several more websites as well, but the purpose of mentioning this method in detail is that new marketers and business owners can save a lot of money in the beginning of their projects by using this.\n\n**Social Media**\n\nInitially we were not considering social media as an option, but three months later when they started generating revenue organically from SEO, we proposed some ideas that can be tested over the social media to them. Since we were working on engagement rings primarily on SEO for now, we decided to prepare our initial social media strategy around that only. \n\nBefore someone starts social media marketing, it is very important to understand the basic psychology of your potential customers or people in general who might come across your product in their feeds. People on social media either want entertainment or they want to feel some sort of personal connection with others, they want to know about others, this is the basic mindset of the majority of the population who spends time on these platforms. If you try to go against this mindset of your potential customers, it can be beneficial or even very beneficial but in the short term. But as the competition is increasing more and more, survival over social media for brands that are just promoting their products will become very hard. \n\nUsually in our social media projects we try to create a brand around the owners instead of promoting just a company. Because people can easily establish connections with other people and that is the whole purpose of social media. When it comes to jewelry and especially engagement rings, this niche can be somewhat related to couples. Considering all these factors we decided that our middle aged clients can be really good faces for the brand over social media. \n\nWe posted content around four content pillars over social media:\n\n**1) Emotional Connect**: This was a very innovative idea which I believe no jewelry brand is doing as of now on a regular basis. Usually the owners have consultation sessions with the person who wants to buy a consultation ring. So we know their entire story, like how they first met, what sort of relationship they had and based on that plus their budget our clients recommend rings to their customers. What we did is, once a sale was made, both husband and wife(our clients) would record a reel where they would describe the story of their customers and based on which ring they recommended and in the end, or in the middle of the reel, we used to display the ring as well. Our clients definitely used to ask for permission from their customers before making a reel. These types of posts were the best performing ones for us. In our social media calendar, these posts had 50% weightage.\n\n2) **Entertainment:** Even if you are getting good results, but still posting just one type of content can make you profile look less professional and also it is very important to keep experimenting. So under this type, we decided to post asmr reels of the jewelry designing process. This also worked well for us. These posts had 25% weightage in our calendar.\n\n \n\n3) **Informative:** It is very important to establish yourself as an expert in your niche. Because this establishes you as an authority in your niche and increases trust. Under this pillar, one of the owners used to make slightly technical informative reels about a jewelry that they might have recently designed. We tried to keep the content very easy to understand so it was amusing for many people. These posts had 15% weightage in our calendar.\n\n4) **Promotional:** If you are posting quality content regularly, your audience won’t mind some rare promotional posts. If the timing and offer is good, these posts can help in revenue generation as well. We used to promote our offers, new designs and best selling products through these posts. These posts had 10% weightage in our calendar.\n\nWe always try to maintain a mix of four content pillars in our social media content strategy. This gives good room for experimenting and also provides a good variety of content for the followers. The content pillars can vary depending on the business.\n\nSocial media accounted for just 10% of our total revenue but considering that we invested only 3 months on this, we feel there is huge potential in social media as well apart from SEO and in future, social media can at least account for 20-25% of our revenue. Also social media plays a huge role in brand building so we will get more direct searches on google and conversions from there as well.\n\n**The Road Ahead**\n\nWe were working with this client till April, but they discontinued the project for 2 months due to some of their personal reasons. But we have again started working on the project since July 1st week. Some of their SEO traffic went down in this time, so since we have re-started the project we have invested our time in regaining the previous amount of visitors. They were posting social media reels regularly as they made several reels in advance. Now the SEO rankings are almost back on track so we can focus on working towards new categories.\n\n \n\nWe haven’t started our ads campaigns yet and are not planning to start anytime soon because considering SEO, whatever results we have achieved till now are just from some sub categories in engagement rings. So there are some sub categories still left in engagement rings and apart from this, all the other categories are still left to explore.   The clients are really happy with the progress as their profits are much more than they used to make from their shop even before covid and still around 70-80% of the keywords are left to optimize which shows that we can achieve even more amazing results just from SEO. \n\n\n\nThankyou For Reading!",

So my job was to increase the amount of online leads they get.\n\nFirst thing i did apart from creating a social media strategy and fixing their website funnels was starting a blog for them. \n\nBasically this was a competitive industry that had very few thought leaders with authority online. I scanned the content online of competitors and realized how i can do things different. Because there was not enough thought leaders with authority, it left the end consumer uneducated about the industry.\n\nSo what i did was i built a very strong client avatar and identified the key pain points of the end consumer. I then created a content strategy (series of blog topics) that solve this problem for the consumer with information education\n\nI probably published around 10 articles each around 1000-2000 words by also looking at seo key word trends what people were searching for.\n\nOut of those 10 one of them really took off. It turned out that topic was the biggest pain point for customers and what they had been searching for online. And the article i wrote was seriously comprehensive step by step guide on how services in this industry work. I left nothing for thought, and didnt care about how long it would be because i knew the target client would value this. Article ended up around 2700 words. \n\nBecause no one in the industry wanted to reveal how their internal systems work (ie keep customer in the dark and charge what they want) we were the only people who had revealed this info it became the top search result on google rank for those specific keywords \n\nWhat made this quicker was i took the article and posted it on social media and then ran ads to that piece of content. This brought tones of traffic and increased our google rank credibility\n\nWe started getting 1000s of organic traffic every month from google alone, let alone traffic from paid ads\n\nIn the end of the article i just added a call to action related to the topic (ie find out more by speaking with our consultants)\n\nThat call to action link led to a lead capture form that gave them something in return like a quote\nThen from the quote they qualify the lead on a consultation call and close the deal\n\nThis translated to 1000s of leads and 100s of customers and millions of closed contracts over the course of few years. Each year the revenue doubled and its still bringing leads till today\n\nI just keep advertising it on social and change the creative video or post but they still lead to the same article\n\nFeel free to ask me anything!",

      "title": "5 steps to get cited in ChatGPT (AI visibility)",
      "selftext": "I'm an SEO consultant who's been obsessing over why some content gets cited in ChatGPT/Perplexity and some doesn't. Since november 2024 I’ve been manually tracking this stuff and built a framework that works pretty consistently.\n\nTested it across 200+ pages. The patterns are honestly super clear once you see them.\n\nFirst thing I check: stat density. Pages need like 3-5 statistics per 1000 words minimum. Took one article that was getting cited maybe 2 out of 10 times. Added 6 stats throughout, didn't change anything else. Now it gets cited 8/10 times.\n\nNot just \"email marketing is effective\" but like \"B2B email open rates average 21.5%, Tuesday sends perform 18% better\" … that kind of specific stuff.\n\nLLMs seem to really prioritize quantifiable info. Pages with 5+ stats get cited like 3x more in my testing.\n\nSecond thing: quote ready sentences. Your key insights gotta be able to stand alone. Bad version: \"The challenge with AI optimization is that it requires understanding how context affects processing.\" Good version: \"Context is the biggest challenge in AI optimization.\"\n\nChatGPT literally lifts standalone sentences word for word. If you bury your insights in these long complex paragraphs they're basically invisible to LLMs.\n\nPages with 5+ sentences that work as standalone quotes get cited way more .. like 3.2x from what I've tracked.\n\nThird: recency signals. So this one surprised me but content from the last few months gets cited noticeably more than older stuff even when the older content ranks better. Newer embeddings often reflect updated context, and LLMs seem to weight freshness heavier than Google does\n\nI started refreshing our top content quarterly and it made a real difference. An okay article from 2 months ago can actually beat a better article from 2 years ago just on recency alone.\n\nFourth: author credentials. Not just \"By John Smith\" but like \"By John Smith, 12 years in B2B SaaS marketing, worked with 50+ companies\" … that specific.\n\nAdded proper author bios to 15 articles and citation rate went from like 28% to 43% over 4 weeks. LLMs cite credentialed authors way more for queries that mention expertise (like \"how do SEO experts approach X\" type questions).\n\nFifth: schema markup. But only the stuff that actually works:\n\n-HowTo schema - gets you cited like 1.7x more for instructional queries\n\n-FAQ schema - works well\n\n-Speakable schema - literally zero impact, don't waste your time\n\nReal example from last month:\n\nClient's onboarding guide before:\n\n-No stats at all\n\n-Super long paragraphs\n\n-18 months old\n\n-Author listed as \"Marketing Team\"\n\n-No schema\n\n-Result: 0/10 queries cited\n\nAfter fixes:\n\n-Added 7 relevant stats\n\n-Broke key points into standalone sentences\n\n-Refreshed everything to 2025\n\n-Added credentialed author with background\n\n-Implemented HowTo schema\n\n-Result: 7/10 queries cited\n\nTook me like 3 hours total to fix. Measured results over 4 weeks.\n\nOverall results across 200+ pages I've audited:\n\n-Before framework: 12% average citation rate\n\n-After framework: 47% average citation rate\n\n-Pages hitting all 5 criteria: 83% citation rate\n\n-Overall improvement: +292%\n\nwhich sounds made up but that's what the data showed lol\n\nTracking this stuff was honestly annoying. When I started doing this, literally no tools had good AI visibility features. So I was just manually searching 50 queries in ChatGPT every week and logging everything in a spreadsheet.\n\nEventually Semrush added their GEO tracking feature (part of AI Visibility toolkit) and it was the first major tool to actually do this properly.\n\nI still manually checked results for like the first month to make sure the data was reliable and honestly Semrush was both faster and more accurate than what I was seeing when I spot checked Ahrefs later. Saves me probably 5-6 hours a week now.\n\nBut yeah if you're just starting, validate this manually with your top 10-20 queries first. Proves the concept before spending money on tools.\n\nIf you wanna try this.. Pick your top 3 pages by traffic. Run through the 5 checks. Fix whatever's missing. Track it for a month and see.\n\n13% of Google queries already trigger AI Overviews now (was like 6% early last year). Gartner's out here predicting 50% organic traffic decline by 2028. So yeah this stuff isn't really optional anymore.\n\nLet me know what you find.",

      "selftext": "Hey guys, recently been working with a dental clinic from Zurich, helping them with Fb lead form ads, content marketing and CRM automation.\n\nHere's what worked, what didn’t, and why these tips might just save you some headaches and get $ fast if you work in similar niches.\n\n**Ads stats:**\n\n* Leads Generated: 166\n* Ad Spend: 3,500 CHF (\\~$3,800)\n* CPL: 21 CHF ($23) well below the $50–$285 industry average.\n* Projected Revenue: $39,000 - $59,000 (based on deal values)\n\n**What Worked Best:**\n\n**1. Reactivate Clinic Database First**  \nWe started by emailing and texting old leads of the clinic (that were considered dead 💀)\n\n* Out of 1k prospects, within 2 weeks, **15 appointments** were booked.\n\n**2. Respond to Leads in Under 5 Minutes**  \nAutomatic email and SMS to notify staff the second a lead form was submitted, and initiate a bridge call so the lead got contacted instantly. (if out of biz hours - the lead gets an email and contacted next day)'\n\n* **30-40%** more bookings\n\n**3. No Stock Content**  \nI have a video/photographer so we have shot real photos and videos of the clinic’s staff and space. Authenticity boosted trust and:\n\n* CTR improved **by 29%**.\n\n**4. Decrease No-Shows**  \nNo-shows were a big issue for this clinic, so we automated **3 reminders** for every appointment:\n\n1. 24 hours before\n2. The morning of the appointment\n3. 1 hour before\n\n* We got **30% fewer** no-shows by the end of the month.\n\n**5. Highlight Your USP**  \nThe clinic’s USP was Premium Veneers product (very few clinics in Switzerland have them) and the best price for \"All on 4\" procedures. We plastered that everywhere: ad copy, visuals, landing page, social media.\n\n* Engagement rates jumped.\n* Conversion rates **tripled** compared to generic messaging.\n\n**6. Automate Follow-Ups**  \nLeads need multiple nudges to book. We set up a CRM with **5 automated follow-ups** (I'd suggest even more) via SMS and email, ensuring no one fell through the cracks.\n\n* **35% of leads converted to appointments** (58 out of 166)\n\nFollow-ups aren’t optional. Leads forget, get busy, or lose interest—remind them.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts! What’s worked for you when running lead gen campaigns? Happy to discuss.",

      "title": "Throwaway: Instagrams entire future depends on automation (I saw it firsthand)",
      "selftext": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. Up until 2 months ago I was on the M&amp;A (mergers &amp; acquisitions) team at Meta. I left to work for another company in the social media space, but while I was there I saw enough on the inside to understand how Instagram really thinks about growth and where they’re steering things. Figured I’d share some context because I keep seeing the same bad advice and the same people getting burned.\n\nFirst off, I can’t tell you who you should use, but I can tell you who you should avoid.\n\nPath Social, Kicksta, Upgrow, Wolfgrow. None of these are real growth solutions. They’re glorified bot farms. They recycle fake accounts from overseas, route them through the same IP pools, and hammer Instagram’s flagged API calls until your account gets flagged too. They don’t build communities, they build fake shells that eventually collapse. And yes, Meta knows. These companies have been on compliance watchlists for years.\n\nSo why are they still around? Simple: ads. Path Social in particular spends a ridiculous amount of money on ads with Meta, and that basically buys them time. Meta cashes the checks while quietly banning or throttling the accounts tied to them. It’s a double dip. They profit from the ad spend, then profit again when those same customers crawl back into official ads just to stay visible.\n\nHere’s the bigger truth. Meta doesn’t care about your follower count. They don’t care about influencers gaming the system. The company lives and dies by two numbers:\n\nAverage time on app. That’s the stat they brag about at quarterly shareholder calls. If they can say “time spent per user is up,” Wall Street is happy.\n\nAd revenue. Because that’s the entire business model.\n\nEvery algorithm tweak, every policy change, every shadowban serves those two goals. Anything that doesn’t feed into them gets killed off. That’s why 99% of these “10k followers in a week” type tools never last.\n\nNow here’s the part most people don’t see. Without breaking NDAs, I can say this much: there are exactly two companies worldwide that Meta has quietly allowed to keep operating under a controlled test umbrella. Both are small AI-driven firms. One is based in St. Louis. The other in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nThese companies don’t blast bots or fake engagement. They built server systems that mimic human behavior so closely that Meta can pitch the results as “increased time spent on platform” in their shareholder decks. Both price their services at $300+ a month, not because it costs that much to run, but to keep the user base small and serious. Only accounts with deeper pockets and long-term goals get in. That exclusivity keeps them safer than the mass-market tools that draw attention.\n\nThe Scottsdale company has already been acquired by Meta. Their paying users were grandfathered in and now basically run the software for free under Meta’s controlled testing. If you dig around Crunchbase you can probably figure out which company it is by looking at Meta’s recent acquisitions.\n\nThe St. Louis company is still independent, but here’s the kicker: it already has investment money from Meta and is under contract for business marketing work across the Midwest. Part of me has always wondered if companies like this are basically shells Meta sets up to experiment through, but the outright acquisition of the Scottsdale firm kind of kills that theory. (Shells aren’t really my area, so I’ll admit that part goes above my head.) Either way, it feels inevitable the St. Louis one gets folded in soon too.\n\nThis fits into the bigger roadmap. Instagram has neglected the business and influencer space for years, and now they’re correcting course. Instagram also knows it isn’t the app people get “big” on anymore. Most creators blow up on TikTok first, then spin up an Instagram that just bleeds off followers from their TikTok links. And Meta hates that. Trust me, they know exactly where they stack up in the social media hierarchy right now. I had been with them for a long time, and honestly it’s kind of hurt to watch them morph from a photo app, to a video app, to a live streaming app, and now into a business app. That shift was part of why I left. It feels washed up to me. More power to the brands and business owners who get in early — I know a lot of big-name brands are already using the St. Louis company, so good for them — but it didn’t align with my own career goals. I’m a principled man, lol.\n\nGoing into 2030, Meta is clearly steering Instagram toward being the platform for brands, influencers, and businesses. TikTok will keep dominating the “average person” space with broad organic reach. Instagram is doubling down on being the go-to platform for businesses that need precision — targeting exact demographics, warming up leads, and converting followers into paying customers.\n\nSocial media is splitting into two lanes. TikTok for reach. Instagram for revenue. And Meta is betting heavy on automation to make it happen. Not bots, not spammy junk, but AI systems that drive engagement in ways that can be tied back to sales. From an M&amp;A perspective, this isn’t about giving small creators a fair shot. It’s about building a suite of business tools Meta can sell, scale, and present to Wall Street as the future of digital advertising.\n\nSo if you’re looking at the landscape long-term, hedge your bets accordingly. Instagram is positioning itself as the business platform of the 2030s. The tools they’re rolling out for businesses are way beyond anything they’ve done before, and honestly, they’re impressive.\n\nAt the end of the day, Meta doesn’t want to fight automation. They want to own it. And once these acquisitions are fully folded in, they will.\n\nI had this posted in r/instagrammarketing within 5 days it became the top post in that subreddit, the next day that entire subreddit got banned. So take this information as you will, but there was definitely Meta intervention there. The sub had over 270k members…. ",

Asking people to work for 8 hours and then expect them to move their mouse or keyboard 85% of the time is a very bad criteria to judge somebody’s productivity. I felt drained at the end of the day. \n\nWorking 8 hours on site is very different from working 8 hours in a remote setup. On-site you can move around, take a break for 10-15 minutes and it will be fine. But in a remote setup, you are supposed to be looking at your screen for 8 hours straight.\n\nTechniques like the Pomodoro method help employees stay focused without burning out, but in most remote jobs, such strategies aren’t even considered, let alone implemented.\n\nProductivity should be a measure of the tasks accomplished and not how much you can move your mouse. Stop treating remote employees like some machines.\n\nFelt like ranting. Sorry for the long post.",

I’ve done the hardware and app myself. \nI went with a 4 load cell design to keep things super thin while also maintaining a large weight capacity. Current competition in the coffee scale space charging ALOT of $$ for their scales use an HX711 so it wasn’t hard to make a more precise scale. Just.. don’t use a 9cent ADC..\nThere’s a ring of 64 leds around the perimeter. They project downwards and turn your countertop into a progress display. \nAt the top is mostly power management, right side is cpu and a small piezo, left side is touch control and components for the SH1107 oled screen on the back side.\nI’ve had issues with the SH1107 flickering on camera so I don't like it. I find the SSD oleds are better but I needed the long skinny form factor to fit as close as possible and the long skinny SSD1309 etc are only 32px tall.\nThe cpu is an ESP32 just for TESTING. It’s already been replaced with a nordic chip in the new revision. Clearly the esp32 is terrible for battery but for developing the app it’s been easier for various reasons including enabling a BT classic mode so I can develop easier on my PC rather than reinstalling each little change on my phone.\nI’ve been designing and printing all the plastic parts in the basement as well on some mid range resin printers.",

Get the product made so I can widen my audience beyond crowdfunding.\n\nFor me, having more than 200 people take a leap of faith, pre-ordering something five months from delivery. That’s huge. \n\nThis project has been fully bootstrapped—every step from soldering to filming was done in my basement (except the hero video, that wasn’t my basement but we still did it ourselves). My pre-launch email list converted at around 25%, which seems on par for small campaigns like this (I can expand more on this if anyone wants).\n\nManufacturing Insights (thus far)\nHere’s a quick breakdown for anyone curious or working on hardware:\n\nTooling Costs: My molds have come in at ~$10K for two plastic parts, a rubber top, and a metal ring. The bottom part is overmolded (two molds for one piece), which adds cost but I believe the extra cost is worth it. The difference is hard to describe, but the soft-touch bottom feels worlds apart from the cheap plastic on typical coffee scales.\n\nMaterial Costs: Plastics and rubber cost about $5/unit, including overmolding. \n\nPCB: It’s a big board with 65 RGB LEDs, a high-end ADC, temp sensor, and accelerometer, so costs are higher. This is what is driving up the per unit cost.\n\nAssembly: Still finalizing, but I designed it for efficient assembly. Worst case, I could hand-assemble 20–30 units/day myself if needed. This keeps things flexible.\n\nA note on the funding goal: we could cover the tooling, so the goal was set to produce the first set of units. Not an overall project goal that would cover marketing, tooling, etc etc etc. this is pretty typical.\n\nOne big advantage for me is having a friend in China (we went to school together) who can facilitate smaller production runs. Without that, the usual factory MOQs (minimum order quantities) could have been a deal-breaker. I think tooling and MOQ is where most crowdfunding projects fall apart and fail to ship.\nIf you’re interested in learning more (or grabbing a scale), here’s the campaign link:\n[Indiegogo: Measurrd](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/measurrd-the-world-s-most-advanced-kitchen-scale)\n\nI’d love to hear your feedback or answer any questions.

      "selftext": "Some time ago, my old Kobo ereader broke, which led me to look for a new one. I’ve become increasingly interested in open and repairable hardware, such as the Framework laptop and Fairphone, but have been disappointed by the lack of an ereader equivalent. Additionally, I wasn't satisfied with the design of most ereaders: they typically have a single screen and require some form of case to protect them from damage (Something I didn't have for my Kobo, which explains why it broke ;) ).\n\nI just finished my engineering studies last summer, so I decided to take the leap and see if I could create something that solves these two problems. And now, after a few months of development, I’m excited to announce that the Diptyx E-reader is entering its pre-campaign stage on Crowd Supply!\n\nTo summarize the product: The Diptyx ereader is a dual-screen ereader that runs on an ESP32 and will be made open-source when the crowdfunding campaign has finished. It runs custom software capable of displaying EPUB files and uses two e-ink screens for a book-like reading experience. Through the built-in UI, you can scroll through chapters, add bookmarks, change the font type and size, and much more.\n\nWhen traveling, you can simply fold it closed, protecting the screens and making the device highly portable. But most importantly, the Diptyx uses no DRM and requires no accounts or cloud services, meaning you fully own the device and everything on it!\n\nI designed the hardware all myself, including the electronics and plastic case. The drawings on the outer panels are old ex-libris artworks (a sort of ownership-stamp in books). The software is partially based on prior open-source work, but mostly custom.\n\nFor future versions, I'm excited to try different types of artworks on the pcbs (using different silkscreen colors, plating types, etc), and to try different color schemes overall\n\nI'd love to hear your feedback or questions, and if you're interested you can read more about it on the crowdsupply page: [https://www.crowdsupply.com/diptyx/diptyx-e-reader](https://www.crowdsupply.com/diptyx/diptyx-e-reader)",

I have designed and created the worlds first digital billiard ball. It is basically an IMU in a ball that measures exactly where the cue tip hits the ball. You can read more about it here: [www.digicue.net/digiball](https://www.digicue.net/digiball) The final design works and I now just need to finish working out the contract with my manufacturer and teach my electronic assembler how to make the sensors.\n\nThis effort has been a **part-time solo boot-strapped electronics hardware startup**. Starting this project in 2019, here are the things that I have done myself while already working a full time engineering job:\n\n* Designed prototype 1, using a PIC and an IMU, simple battery to test theory with a blinking light\n* Designed prototype 2, using a BLE module, to test wireless functionality and basic concepts. Made simple program on PC to analyze data.\n* Designed custom BLE meandering antenna to optimize for being encased in phenolic resin\n* Designed wireless charger and receiver, since a billiard ball can not have any plugs/ports\n* Designed prototype 3, using an nRF52 SoC, custom antenna, and custom wireless charger\n* Designed Android App for testing, developed a feel for how the user experience should be\n* Made a dozen prototypes by hand, drilling a hole in a pool ball, inserting sensor, potting and sanding smooth\n* Got some support and funding for a while by an external company\n* Impact / durability / balance tests. Made a robot to test accuracy.\n* Wrote and filed patent myself. Designed trademarks myself.\n* Designed prototype 4,5,6 with different wireless charging chips\n* Learned about EMC and requirements\n* Designed variations of wireless charger and freqency until I found good charge transfer at 10mm and a frequency within FCC pass limits\n* Performed pre-compliance testing myself with rented equipment in a chamber\n* Learned how to use Flutter and Dart, designed App #2 for iOS and Android\n* Designed auxiliary software that can run on PCs if needed\n* Designed many versions of the plastic enclosure for the wireless charger\n* Started working directly with billiard ball manufacturer\n* Redesigned the sensor multiple times to survive the ball manufacturing process\n* Ordered custom lithium ion batteries with special electrolyte to survive the phenolic resin curing process\n* Tweaked antenna since battery and components added a lot of ground-plane\n* Redesigned some more to perfect the density and balance of the sensor due to component distribution\n* Designed even more custom parts to ensure proper weight with center of balance (PTFE plugs, brass and nylon tubes)\n* Manufactured a lot of the parts myself while making the sensors\n* Shipped to manufacturer, and finally, production-ready-success with a launchable app.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot to mention other PCBs I made like a 20-gang lithium ion charger, a battery tester and many weeks of temperature cycling and testing the custom batteries, BLE testers, the entire Nordic nRF52 SDK, and more that I will rememeber the more I type.\n\nI feel like this project design was challenging because everytime I made one change, it affected the weight / balance / density / antenna tuning of the entire product. It took a lot of iterations to get right. And on top of that, I needed to go through ALL of this just to see if the product was even manufacturable. From the small successes I kept having with cold potting I kept going.\n\nI did a solo startup before this one which saw success (8000+ units sold), also for pool, and also while working full time. The chip shortage killed that project with obs parts. But for this project, in the past two years, I got divorced, moved out, met someone new, moved again, got engaged, got married, paid off the wedding, finalized divorce, paid off divorce, moved a third time, and am saving for a house from scratch, and learned a fair bit of Portuguese.\n\nI am feeling tired, and looking back, I don't think people realize how much work hardware can be if you do it all yourself with zero budget.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Please learn from this.\n\nBtw: with \"hardware\" I mean any physical product that needs manufacturing.\n\nIt's one thing to know it and another to actually act according to it. At least take it as a reminder:\n\n1. Most startups fail because they fail to meet the market needs. They only build for themselves. In hardware, you only have one shot, so this is even harder. DON'T develop anything before you have talked to customers for 1-2 months full-time. I've yet to see someone who did not pivot after doing this. Learn how to perform the Mom Test and always have the problem in mind. Not the solution you enjoy building.\n2. In most cases, Kickstarter will not be enough capital to get manufacturing going. Bootstrapping in hardware is thus a bad idea (unless you are already rich enough to pay for a year of development, the tools and the first two batches).\n3. This means you need funding. It is incredibly hard to get funded by VC. It seems like it takes at least half a year full-time effort to have a realistic chance at getting any funding (experience made in Germany).\n4. Do not try to do it alone. I've seen a few founders who tried to do it by themselves or with a meagre team. As a result, they burned out very quickly. IMO: one needs to hunt funding, another needs to build the product and a third team member needs to build the community and do the marketing.\n5. Once you have your team in place, focus relentlessly. Each team member should concentrate on their specific domain rather than spreading themselves thin. Developing and solving business stuff like marketing and funding at the same time is a waste of time. It's most efficient to do one thing after another.\n6. If you are a team of makers, marketing and sales will be your biggest problem. Consider building in public. Build a community.\n7. Actually commit to front-loading: Do not build the first solution that came to mind. At least find 3 solutions for every problem and evaluate them thoroughly. Most of the time there will be a cheaper or a higher quality solution if you actively search for it.\n8. Do not go for a final prototype at first. Use mockups and demonstrators to prove critical parts of the design and again: get customer feedback.\n9. Get help. There are official institutions, sparring partners, networks and business angels that actually want to see you win.\n\nThis is, of course, only my perspective on things. Some things will be different for your case, in your country etc. Still, it's probably a good idea to at least critically consider if there might be a challenge with any of the things I said.\n\nFeel free to disagree and please share some of your insights as well!",

I'm using the remainder of the funds for a crowdfunding campaign in the fall. However, with the pay-to-win state of crowdfunding these days, I don't expect to raise enough money to take this product to the finish line. Therefore, I'm using this crowdfunding campaign as more of a strategy to generate some traction (e.g. generate a waiting list, some pre-product revenue, social-media buzz, etc.) to then take to investors as evidence of early PMF. However, given my conversations with investors so far, I think even with that a lot of them would still be hesitant to invest without a fully-fledged product.\n\nAny advice on how I can approach next steps as a hardware startup?

Price is about **$950 USD**.\n\nFor comparison, the same package at **Mayo Clinic or Cleveland Clinic costs $10k+**. Abroad, it’s literally the same quality (JCI-accredited hospitals, many doctors trained in the U.S./Europe).\n\nIt’s direct-to-consumer, not through employers, and it’s also **HSA/FSA eligible** \\- including flights and hotels if you want to turn it into a wellness trip.\n\nWho it’s for: Health-conscious professionals who want peace of mind without dropping five figures, or anyone who likes the idea of bundling a check-up with a vacation.\n\nStage: Just launched pilot runs. Already had a few patients fly out for check-ups. Right now I’m testing if there’s real demand.\n\nWhy me: I'm obsessed with health, ran a travel agency, and have traveled abroad for medical care myself a lot in the past! This is kind of a mashup of those worlds.\n\n**Link:** [globalizedhealth.co](https://www.globalizedhealth.co)\n\nBrutal feedback welcome, would you ever consider flying abroad for a check-up?

And the index is growing all the time, we hope to get better and better!\n* **Similar images, not only exact copies:** something that many engines do is finding only copies. We do that and way more.\n* **User-friendly design:** A big chunk of competition is not user-friendly at all. We are making a design that will lead more users to [lenso.ai](http://lenso.ai)\n* **Place recognition:** Lenso is very accurate with recognising buildings and landscapes, unlike most search engines.\n* **Search with text or URL:** we allow users to define URL of website they want to look at or add text so the search is more accurate (upload blue mug, add text \"red\", red mugs appear).\n\n**Use cases:** Finding the source of images, finding original versions of edited pictures, finding images in higher resolutions, finding your face online, looking up objects and people, checking for copyright infringement, online shopping, finding places from image\n\n**Who would want it?** We believe it would be useful for photographers (for copyright), public people (to find who posts them and where), general audiences (most people want to find their face online or used google lens to find objects/books/movies).\n\n**The market** is projected to reach US$13.72bn in 2024 and still growing. Our biggest competitors are Google, Yandex, Bing, but also some smaller sites, like Pimeyes, Copyseeker etc. Some are huge companies, but we believe in the next stages of growth Lenso will be just as good if not better.\n\n**We find customers by** posting on different forums, databases for AI tools, recommending to people on groups related to reverse image search, writing articles. We also post on social media and plan to post on youtube soon.\n\n**We are in the stage** where the product is already posted and usable, but we are still developing additional features, such as: email notifications on new results, exporting results to CSV and more. We are not looking to raise money to develop, but we are planning to earn from the project in the future.\n\n**Why us?** Our team has years of experience in reverse image search and face recognition from working in other projects. There are a few developers working on the project, all experienced and skilled.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback :)",

      "selftext": "**Hi roasters,**\n\nI've been working on something called [Communities](https://www.communities.site/roadmap) \\- it's my attempt at creating a different kind of social media platform. I'm hoping to get some honest feedback from you all to see if this idea has any merit.\n\nThe basic concept is location-based social networking that focuses on local communities rather than individual profiles or endless feeds designed to serve ads. The idea came from wanting to encourage real-world connections - you'd open the app to see what's happening in your area (events, discussions, local spots) and hopefully get inspired to actually go out and experience it.\n\nI know this might sound naive, but I'm trying to build something that's driven by users rather than advertisers. Instead of keeping people glued to screens, the goal would be to help them connect with their local community and get offline.\n\nWe're still in very early stages (pre-alpha), and honestly, I'm not sure if this concept will resonate with people. That's why I'm reaching out - I really need some genuine feedback to understand if this is worth pursuing.\n\nI'd be incredibly grateful for any thoughts, even if you think this is a terrible idea! I'm particularly looking for feedback on the user experience, any bugs or errors you encounter, feature suggestions, or really anything else you think would be important for me as a developer to know about the platform. Even small details about what felt confusing or what worked well would be super helpful.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this - any feedback at all would mean a lot!\n\nIf anyone's interested in following along or sharing more detailed feedback, you can join a small Discord community at [https://discord.gg/KBRfvr6FBc](https://discord.gg/KBRfvr6FBc)",

That's important to me as my UI/UX skills also include coding in HTML/CSS/JS\n* Bonus: The white on blue looks like a cloud in the sky lol.\n\nIt was such a battle trying to brand myself in a way that covers everything I do, but I think I ended up with something really solid.

Cutting this down has been hard, but life changing.\n\nI feel like my life has slowed down (in a good way) and I have time for all the things I’ve been wanting to do (read, meditate, exercise).\n\nMy biggest takeaways are:\n\n* There is more time in the day than you realize\n* It's extremely easy to \"slip\", as I have many times in the past\n* Being \"productive\" doesn't always mean reaching for your phone just for the sake of doing something — sometimes doing nothing can set you up for more long term productivity\n* We are meant to be bored sometimes (and being bored can make you enjoy the little things more)\n\nThe biggest things that helped were:\n\n* Creating 30 day plan, each week my goal was to cut back one hour (ended up doing more)\n* Asking “is this the best usage of mental energy right now?” each time I reach for my phone (I reminded myself to ask this question with a rubber band over my phone)\n* Having a go to \"redirect\", I keep a book next to my phone so I can pick that up instead\n* Using an app blocker with stricter settings than iOS screen time (iOS defaults are too easy to skip)\n   * Set up \"morning\" and \"evening\" downtime to block distracting apps 5-9a, and 6-midnight\n   * Set up specific daily limits or # of opens on each individual distracting app\n* Embrace the boredom, our minds tend to panic when we don't have \"something to do\", but if you can push through the initial panic, there is a real sense of calm on the other side\n\nNow I find myself craving more phone free-time, it's like I've tasted freedom and my mind wants more. I am going to experiment with longer and longer phone-free breaks. My next goal is to stay under 1 hour and see what all that unlocks over the next month...",

      "selftext": "\nAfter my last post about dopamine depletion resonated with so many of you, I wanted to share the practical steps that actually helped me rewire my brain. No theoretical fluff – just real, tested methods from someone who's been in the trenches.\n\nLet me be real with you: implementing these changes wasn't smooth sailing. There were days I fell back into old patterns, moments of frustration, and times I questioned if it was worth it. But looking back now, these strategies fundamentally changed how I approach life and productivity.\n\nHere's what actually worked for me:\n\n* Morning Sanctuary: I replaced the instant phone grab with 30 minutes of peace. Just water, window gazing, and letting my mind settle. The first week was torture – my hand would literally twitch toward my phone. Now? It's the most peaceful part of my day. The urge to check notifications eventually fades, I promise.\n\n* Movement Medicine: Skip the intense workout pressure. I discovered that simple movement – like walking without podcasts or dancing badly while making breakfast – gives me a more sustainable dopamine boost than endless doomless scrolling ever did. Your body literally rewards you for basic movement, no gym membership required.\n\n* Real Connection Reset: Having coffee with friends, phones face-down, felt weirdly uncomfortable at first. Those silent moments where we'd usually hide in our screens? They turned into the deepest conversations I've had in years. The human connection hits different when you're fully present.\n\n* Analog Joy: Found myself picking up origami (of all things). There's something deeply satisfying about creating something physical with your hands. Whether it's drawing, writing in a journal, or building something – tangible activities give you that dopamine hit without the digital drain.\n\n* Single-Task Revolution: Turns out, my brain wasn't designed for constant task-switching. When I work, I just work. When I rest, I actually rest (revolutionary, I know). It felt impossible at first, but like training a puppy, my mind gradually learned to stay focused.\n\n* Evening Rituals: Created a proper shutdown sequence for my day instead of streaming until my eyes blur. Sometimes it's reading an actual book, sometimes just sitting with my thoughts. My sleep quality skyrocketed, and morning-me is way less grumpy.\n\nHere's the real talk: this isn't about becoming some digital monk or never enjoying Netflix again. I still use technology, but now I'm in control, not the other way around. Some days are better than others, and that's completely okay.\n\nRemember, these changes took months, not days. Start small, be patient with yourself, and know that every tiny victory counts.\n\nDrop a comment about which strategy you're going to try first – let's keep supporting each other on this journey.\n\nEdit: Since some of you asked – yes, this is all from personal experience. The struggles, the setbacks, and the small wins are all real. Thanks for creating this space where we can have honest conversations about something we all face.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

      "title": "How I went from super tired in the morning to energized - a foolproof way to get your body started",
      "selftext": "I know that getting up in the morning is often the hardest part of the day, and I was suffering from the same problem for 20 years. I wanted to share something that is helped me immensely.\n\nThe key is stimulating as many senses as possible. The human body has 5 main senses: Seeing, hearing, feeling, tasting, smelling\n\nMost people only rely on number 2, but by forcing your body to process a combination of multiple, it makes it a lot easier for your body to wake up. No 5-second rituals or anything conscious on your end - just your body realizing it's time to wake up.\n\nTo illustrate, this is my personal wake-up environment:\n\nMaterials: Sunrise alarm clock (Phillips), Smart Phillips Hue lights, Apple HomePods, Eight-sleep temperature controlled mattress, Apple watch / Whoop band\n\nI usually go to bed around 2-4am and wake up at 9:00am. Black-out curtains are all pulled, so it's pitch black.\n\nAt 8:30am, my sunrise alarm clock starts gradually getting brighter and my eight-sleep mattress starts getting colder (this is better than hotter, as it kick starts your body's metabolism to try to heat up). At 8:45am, my smart lights around my bed turn on to 50%. At 9:00am, my smart lights turn to 100%, my HomePods start playing soft Lofi music, my Apple Watch haptic alarm goes off, and my mattress turns quite cold.\n\nBy this point, my body has already been waking up gradually over the last half hour, and even if I was in deep/REM sleep, my body seems to get the signal. The continuous LoFi music makes it impossible to fall back asleep as my ears are continually processing things.\n\nSince I've started this, I've never had a morning where I was super groggy, even with suboptimal sleep.\n\nHope this helps!\n\n\\---\n\nEdit 1: Some people are mentioning the difficulty of acquiring the rather pricey items that I use for my routine. These are just what I use, but they're by no means the only solution. You can definitely reap most of the rewards for a fraction of the cost.\n\nAs light brings the most benefit, start by searching up \"Amazon basics smart a19 led light bulb\". As others have mentioned, you can also use a time-controlled fan for temperature control (which may work even better as you can physically feel the wind). For sound, you can keep using your phone/alarm, but I would recommend music that plays alongside your morning routine instead of ending abruptly, as it's a more peaceful transition. In any case, focus on the themes, not the gadgets!\n\n\\---\n\nEdit 2: My personal thought process behind this setup:\n\nAfter trying out many different \"hacks\" for waking up (i.e. putting my phone alarm far from bed, making my bedroom uncomfortable, setting a timer, etc), I realized how I was just fighting my body every day and starting the day off on the wrong foot. I then thought back to all the times where I didn't get enough sleep but still was able to leave my bed fairly easily. Most of them followed a common theme - environmental stimulation &amp; chaos. By making my body subconsciously aware that the world around me is moving (through the 5 senses), I let it take care of waking itself up.\n\n\\---\n\nEdit 3: 7-8 hours of sleep is key, of course. Unfortunately, we all have our own schedules and sometimes things don't go to plan. This setup is just to make things easier when things don't always go your way (or if you're tired no matter how much you sleep, like me)",

      "selftext": "My uncle, who has not one but two PhDs, reads one book a week. Some of my fondest memories with him were our trips bashing about London, going to every used bookstore. He reads everything, from politics to history to cooking to books on how to write. It always amazed me as a boy, though I didn’t understand why he read SO much. He reads more than anyone else I ever met before or since. So I asked once in my teenage years why he kept on reading so much well into his fifties and sixties. Here’s what he told me:\n\n“Lad, I don’t remember 90% of the material I’ve read. I’m not reading to memorise certain facts or to have a bank of useful information to pull from later. I read because it’s edifying. It changes the way I think, even if just for a moment, and what the brain forgets, the body remembers. I’m a different person now than I would have been had I not read so much, even if the majority of the content is wiped clean from my memory. Don’t read to learn for the future; read to learn right now. It will change you and your perspective without you ever noticing. That’s why I read and will continue to read.” \n\nYou ever have a moment that’s life changing, even if you don’t realise it at the time? That was one of those fundamental, core moments for me. Even now, 15 years later, I still aim to read a book a week (though admittedly it takes me a bit longer than my uncle). And after reading hundreds of books, articles, and essays in my life, I can say that he was right. I don’t remember hardly any of what I read, but that’s ok. Reading has changed me in ways I couldn’t imagine. It’s widen my interests, my perspective, my vocabulary. And I know without a doubt I would not be who I am today had I not read so much. \n\nDon’t read to learn for the future. Read to learn now.

      "selftext": "TL;DR: Quit caffeine for 30 days. First week was brutal (headaches, brain fog, tired), but after that my focus and energy became more stable. Productivity improved, sleep got way better, and I feel less anxious. Don’t think I’m going back.\n\nLike a lot of people, I’ve been pretty dependent on caffeine for years. Coffee in the morning, another by noon, maybe another or an energy drink in the afternoon, felt like the only way to function. But I started wondering: am I actually more productive, or am I just running on fumes?\n\nSo I decided to quit caffeine for 30 days. No coffee, no tea, no energy drinks. Cold turkey. Here’s what happened:\n\nWeek 1: Absolute hell.\nHeadaches, fatigue, brain fog. Felt like I was walking through molasses. My mood tanked, and I honestly considered giving up more than once. Sleep got deeper almost immediately, but waking up was brutal.\n\n\nWeek 2: The brain fog started lifting.\nThe headaches were mostly gone, but my focus was still shaky. Interestingly, I started feeling calmer. My energy wasn’t high, but it felt more stable. Less jittery, less anxious. The main thing I noticed was that my stress levels plummeted, despite a more hectic schedule and increased workload with deadlines approaching.\n\n\nWeek 3: Natural focus kicked in.\nMy brain started working again but differently. My energy felt smoother and more consistent throughout the day. I stopped getting that afternoon crash. Sleep quality kept improving too.\n\n\nWeek 4: No desire to go back.\nI felt clearer. More in control. My productivity didn’t tank like I thought it would, it actually improved. I wasn’t riding the caffeine rollercoaster anymore.\n\n\n\nBiggest takeaway: Caffeine was masking my tiredness, not fixing it. Without it, I had to confront why I was so tired in the first place (bad sleep habits, stress, etc.). Fixing that made a bigger difference than coffee ever did. I think I'll still go back to one coffee in the morning occasionally (no more than two or three times a week), but never again to the same level as before.",

Every time I caught myself procrastinating, I'd quickly jot down:\n\n* What I was supposed to be doing\n* What I was doing instead (usually scrolling Reddit or watching yt shorts)\n* How I was feeling in that moment\n\nAnd then I would read it at the end of the day. At first, it felt pointless. But after a few weeks, I started noticing patterns. Turns out, I wasn't just being \"lazy\" - I was avoiding specific types of tasks when I felt overwhelmed or unsure where to start. I am a software dev who also do the product management at my company. And I hate doing \"research\" on features.\n\nThe weird thing is, just being aware of these patterns made them easier to deal with. When I know that if i had to do research, greater changes i won't be productive today. And now Instead of beating myself up, I started break down the scary tasks into smaller chunks.\n\nI'm not saying I'm some productivity guru now and I still waste time watching stupid yt videos when I should be working. But holy shit, the difference is night and day. Projects that used to take me forever to start are getting done without the usual last-minute panic.",

      "selftext": "Hey r/productivity! I wanted to share an experiment I tried recently that honestly changed my relationship with time-wasting and learning.\n\nLike many of you, I used to mindlessly scroll through social media whenever I had a few spare minutes - waiting for coffee, on the bus, or even (embarrassingly) on the toilet. One day, I calculated I was spending about 2.5 hours daily just... scrolling.\n\nSo I decided to try something different: replacing every social media urge with a 5-10 minute learning session. Here's what I did:\n\n**My Setup:**\n\n* Deleted social apps from my phone\n* Downloaded: Duolingo, Brilliant, and a Kindle app\n* Bookmarked some educational Yt channels\n* Installed Pocket for saving interesting articles\n\n**What I learned in 30 days:**\n\n* Basic conversational Spanish (15-20 phrases I can actually use)\n* Finally understood how compound interest actually works\n* Basics of stock market and investing\n* Read 2 full books in \"bite-sized\" chunks\n* Learned to solve a Rubik's cube (via short yt tutorials)\n\n**The Unexpected Benefits:**\n\n1. Better sleep - no more late-night scrolling\n2. Reduced anxiety - less FOMO, more actual accomplishment\n3. Better conversations - I actually had interesting things to share\n4. Increased focus - my attention span noticeably improved\n\n**The Challenges:**\n\n* First week was HARD. My thumb literally twitched for Instagram\n* Had to fight the urge to turn learning into another mindless activity\n* Sometimes felt disconnected from friends' daily updates\n* Needed to actively plan what I wanted to learn\n\n**Tips if you want to try:**\n\n* Start with topics you're genuinely curious about\n* Keep learning sessions under 10 minutes\n* Have multiple options ready (different apps/materials)\n* Don't beat yourself up if you slip up\n\nThe biggest surprise? After 30 days, I didn't even want to go back to my old social media habits. I still use them, but now it's intentional and limited.\n\n**TLDR:** Replaced mindless scrolling with mini-learning sessions. Learned actual skills, felt more productive, and broke my social media addiction.\n\nHas anyone else tried something similar?",

      "selftext": ".\n\nTired of feeling like you're constantly fighting an uphill battle against procrastination? I've been there. For years, I felt like I was stuck in a cycle of endless distractions and a complete lack of motivation. I'd want to get things done, need to get things done, but somehow, I'd always find myself sucked into the black hole of social media or mindlessly scrolling through Netflix.\nI thought I was lazy. I'd beat myself up, call myself undisciplined, and generally feel like a complete failure. But then, I started to learn about the science behind it all – the role of dopamine in motivation and how our modern world is designed to constantly hijack our reward systems.\nIt clicked. I wasn't lazy; I was dopamine-depleted. My brain was constantly craving the instant gratification of likes, notifications, and quick wins, leaving me feeling drained and unmotivated for anything that required sustained effort.\nSound familiar?\nThe good news is, you can break free. It takes time and effort, but you can absolutely rewire your brain and cultivate the discipline you crave.\nHere's what helped me:\n * Digital Detox: I started small. I'd put my phone on \"Do Not Disturb\" for an hour in the morning, then gradually increased the duration. I deleted social media apps from my phone and replaced them with reading apps or meditation apps.\n * Embrace Boredom: I know, it sounds counterintuitive, but allowing myself to experience periods of boredom actually increased my creativity and forced me to find other ways to entertain myself.\n * Mindful Moments: I started incorporating mindfulness practices like meditation and deep breathing into my daily routine. It helped me become more aware of my thoughts and feelings, and better able to resist the urge to constantly seek out distractions.\n * The Power of Small Wins: I broke down large, overwhelming tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Completing these smaller tasks gave me a sense of accomplishment and kept me motivated to keep going.\nIt wasn't easy, and there were definitely setbacks along the way. But with consistent effort and a focus on building sustainable habits, I've been able to significantly improve my focus, productivity, and overall well-being.\nYou can do it too.\nStart small, be patient with yourself, and celebrate your progress.\nI'm here for you. Let me know in the comments if you have any questions or want to share your own experiences.\nDisclaimer: This post is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice. If you are struggling with addiction or mental health concerns, please consult with a qualified healthcare professional.\nI hope this resonates with you!\n",

I didn't want to completely delete it because I use it to communicate with friends and I wanted to see if I could still use it but not obsessively.\n\n**2) Turned on grayscale**  \nI hate it, and don't always leave it on… but it works when I do it. It makes your phone way less addicting, and boring to use even on the addicting apps.\n\n**3) Completely block Insta and social from 7pm to 7am**  \nI racked up a lot of time while watching TV, and in the middle of the night, and in the morning — all of it was time I regretted. I still let myself watch TV at night, but at least I'm not double screening and I'm focused on just the TV which feels much more relaxing.\n\n**4) Find better replacements**  \nThis was a important one for me. Replacing scrolling with things I'd rather do (read, play guitar, call friends, study, etc).\n\n* I have a lot of books I have ordered but never read, so I'm keeping a book next to me to fill the small times.\n* I love playing music and writing music but my guitar was collecting dust. Just playing guitar a few times a day puts me in a much more creative and relaxed mood.\n* I'm calling my friends who I have not talked to in a while.\n* And, I'm learning new things (in moderation). It's so easy to bombard ourselves with too much information, so I'm picking less things and going deep on them with whatever gets me excited, and with no attachment.\n\n",

We ran a lot of simulations and tested prototypes until we landed on a design that could hold TVs over 100 pounds securely.\n\nThe end result was Hangsmart TV, a bracket you can hang up in under 5 minutes. We tested it, refined it, and eventually it ended up on shelves at Walmart, Home Depot, and Amazon. Reviews from renters and DIYers were huge because it meant no more damaging walls or hiring installers.\n\nWhat I liked most about this project was that it shows how an idea that sounds impossible can work if you engineer it the right way.

Despite presenting mediocre solutions, their work felt quite performative and lacking in substance.\n\nOne of the reasons the UX industry has become so dysfunctional might be this kind of performative work culture centered around storytelling. The ideas they showed weren’t particularly compelling or innovative, but yes — they presented them fairly well, with platitudes and polished delivery.\n\nUX should focus more on technical skills rather than soft skills. People often claim that UX is half art and half science, but in reality, it’s entrenched in stakeholder management, getting buy-in, and design advocacy. These dynamics often shift power and decision-making control to businesspeople and engineers, pushing designers into a more peripheral role.\n\nThe UX industry should stop overemphasizing storytelling and stakeholder management. When everyone talks about creativity and problem-solving, shouldn’t we also be finding new opportunities for a better future?",

      "selftext": "Been analyzing onboarding flows across different app types. Noticed something interesting: apps with 30+ onboarding steps are almost exclusively in health and fitness.\n\nWhy make users answer so many questions before using the app? Because these apps need personalization data to deliver value. A workout app can't recommend exercises without knowing your fitness level. A nutrition app can't suggest meals without dietary preferences.\n\nThe pattern that works: show value proposition first, then collect data. Cal AI does this well- shows what it can do, then asks for information to personalize.\n\nBut established apps like Yazio only shows social proof then skip straight to data collection. They can do this because users already trust and understand the value.\n\nWhile browsing Screensdesign, found that 90% of apps with extensive onboarding are health/fitness related. [Noom](https://screensdesign.com/apps/noom-weight-loss-food-tracker) has over 100 steps. That would kill most apps, but for personalized health recommendations, users tolerate it.\n\nThe lesson is that long onboarding works when users understand that answering questions directly improves their experience. Otherwise, every extra step is just friction. New apps in the same space can't assume that trust yet.\n\nContext determines whether data collection is valuable setup or pointless barrier. Know your category and trust level before deciding onboarding length.",

The best part was during covid everyone had to work from home and I used that to my advantage by interviewing from home.\n\nI know, I know during hard times people will tell you \"there's always light at the end of the tunnel\" but I couldn't believe it nor see it.

I’m swiping through pages and pages of artists and playlists, completely lost. They took away the simple one button to add a song to my Liked playlist and made it a multi click task. They brought it back in some views.\n\nThe worst is they took away the main reason I signed up: instead of introducing new songs I might like, they play the same top 20 songs over and over. All the careful thought is gone and for what? Peddling Joe Rogan podcasts that I will never listen to, ever?\n\nEdit: It’s an interesting case where both the UI and the UX are different and distinct, and had different roles. Spotify managed to screw up BOTH.\n\nThe UI is shit, because they added all these new features such as podcasts and audiobooks. It’s confusing to find what I want.\n\nThe UX is shit because I mainly listen to Spotify in the car or through headphones while commuting. I depended on the algorithm to serve up a good experience without having to keep looking at my device. By changing the algorithm, it plays the same songs over and over, so now I HAVE to interact with the interface to change it.\n\nI’m testing Apple Music (I miss the old iTunes) and Google Music now.

Most of the people who have come through have been disqualified.

We don't post the salary range (we pay competitively), so we're seeing huge variations in what people are asking for (a difference of \\~$50k for people with about 4 years of experience), but the resumes at the bottom of that range look identical to the ones at the top of the range.\n\nFor those of you who are very effective recruiters, how on Earth do you effectively screen resumes/applications?

What I didn’t expect was how hard it would be to stay consistent with prep while managing a full-time job.\n\n# Some of the challenges I ran into:\n\n* Not knowing where to begin or which topics to prioritize\n* Struggling to stay focused after work hours\n* Wanting to go beyond Trailhead and get more hands-on practice\n* Keeping up with the latest Salesforce features and best practices\n\nSo instead of jumping randomly between resources, I decided to follow a more structured approach using **ChatGPT**. Here’s what I did:\n\n1. **Identified key areas** I wanted to focus on—Apex, LWC, Flows, Security, Data Modeling, etc.\n2. **Uploaded a few blog articles or docs** on each topic and asked ChatGPT to quiz me on them.\n3. For each question, I tried to answer it myself, then asked ChatGPT to explain the correct answer and the reasoning behind it.\n4. I repeated this across topics, and it helped me retain concepts better and spot my weak areas.\n5. I also used it to generate small code snippets or scenarios to practice hands-on.\n\nThis framework helped me stay consistent and made the prep feel more interactive and less overwhelming.\n\n# Here is the Prompt I used:\n\nPlay the role of a Salesforce Tech Lead who is interviewing me on &lt;TOPIC - Flow, Apex etc &gt;. I want you to go through the attached blog articles and then ask me a series of questions one by one starting from easy to difficult. I will answer each questions one by one and you will respond with the right answer, also give relevant link to blog article/ salesforce document in case i want to read more about it. After each answer ask me another questions. At the end give me a score and identify areas where i am strong and weak and need more focus.\n\nI’m curious—how do you all prepare for Salesforce interviews? Do you follow a structure or just go with the flow?\n\nAlso, I’ve been working on a tool based on this framework—something that combines interactive questions (MCQ, Drag &amp; Drop, Code Completion etc), AI summary explanations of answers, deep learning with link to top blog articles on the question and performance tracking/ prep plan. \n\nYou can register here for early access - [https://preview--smartforce-interview-ready.lovable.app/](https://preview--smartforce-interview-ready.lovable.app/)\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and prep strategies!",

They mentioned that something was stuck with my security clearance process, and that they did not have access to identify the issue due to privacy. Later that same day, I got an email from their candidate intake stating the same. \n\nInterestingly, I only got this update after contacting them multiple times. \n\nThis leads me to believe the following:\n\nThey're lying about actually available roles, and just want a backlog of resumes for theoretical jobs that may not exist. \n\nThis is unethical because they're acting as if a job is truly there, and have no issues stringing candidates along for months with false promises of non-existent work. \n\nI highly recommend that NOBODY should apply with them, as if this is how they manage the hiring process, how will they handle you as an employee? \n\nORIGINAL:\n\nNoticed the company Steampunk continuing to post new jobs all the time, and well-paying ones.\n\nMy experience with them so far has been the following:\n\n1.) Began interviewing with them in July of last year and passed through three rounds of interviews before being confirmed for a role that would start in September.\n\n2.) Funding fell through, so got switched to another role that would begin in November of last year and went through two more technical interviews, both of which I passed.\n\n3.) Received a high-paying offer in October of last year. Submitted paperwork and began security clearance screening for the role, as they handle government contracts only.\n\n4.) Followed up continually, with communication coming ONLY from my side and no communication iniating from Steampunk whatsoever, but each conversation assured that the role was still mine, and security was taking an unexpectedly long time.\n\n5.) Told that the project was yet to be funded, but they were projected to begin in the second week of January now, and that I was set for that project when it came up.\n\n6.) Told more recently that they were set to receive funding for the role instead at the end of March, and once funding came through, they would begin placing people on the project, and that I was at the top of that list.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nThis was nearly a year-long process to \\*maybe\\* get a job that doesn't actually exist. \n\nI'm not sure if this company is running some kind of scam, or if they receive funding for job postings, but I can't imagine their processes are efficient.\n\nPerhaps your experience will be different from mine, but I've in the meantime accepted a separate job offer, while this company is still attempting to string me along.\n\nApplicant beware.",

Did an inventory of my job-hunting results over the last 7 months since I lost my Salesforce developer job. 8 years of prior experience, that I'd admit (not in an interview) has been underwhelming, in that I haven't built anything particularly impressive (imposter's syndrome X honest assessment). At that age where ageism is a thing. Struggling to gain certs because my mind, which can very quickly solve problems with some research/AI help, doesn't retain info well.\n\nDozens of applications, 9 jobs I went through a serious interview process, 5 I made it to the final round. Have gotten 2 offers. One I declined early on because it was more of an admin role and I was close to landing other roles (mistake, now, obviously). One I accepted, but the start date got pushed back indefinitely because the project got delayed indefinitely, and I've needed to assume it's not happening. I think I'm about to get two more final-round rejections. And I've got nothing else in the pipeline. The average duration between application and resolution is two months.\n\nI was more confident and more competent in my interviews over the first few months. But now I freeze up. The hidden desperation messes with my head, and I get flustered when I know I'm giving an incoherent answer to a question I've handled just fine in the past. It's completely fair for hiring managers to be wary of a candidate that they want to be able to present to stakeholders, who is too anxious to make it through a call without calling attention to their stumbling.\n\nNot looking for advice. Someone will give it anyway, and maybe that will help someone else, maybe it will help me when I'm more open to receiving it. At the moment, I'm just very despondent and quite honestly don't know if I'm better off spending my time studying for certs or trying to maximize efforts to do a food delivery gig and find other temp opportunities.",

      "selftext": "YouTube marketing can be defined as the process of promoting a company and its products on the YouTube platform by uploading quality videos to a company’s YouTube channel.\n\nVideo content is the secret to successful content marketing.\n\nBeing successful on YouTube takes planning. Here are some easy steps that are a good place to start.\n\n**Research Keywords**\n\nUse YouTube's Keyword Tool to find popular searches within your space. Optimizing your digital media content for search is just as important as it is for your written content on a blog or website.\n\n**Know your competition**\n\nSearch on YouTube to find other videos that already rank well for the keywords that you would like to rank for. See what it is that you are up against and seek out strategies to out-do them.\n\nThis phase should also help you in your keyword research. Use this research to look into some opportunities that your competitors may not be taking advantage of.\n\n**Create a kick-ass video**\n\nYou don't just create viral content because you want to. Viral content - unless it happens by chance - must be well thought-out and gripping! The most shareable content happens naturally, not intentionally.\n\nThis may sound counterintuitive, but sticking true to your brand and designing digital content that has a purpose for your specific audience will be informative and engaging.\n\n**Fill out your video details**\n\nAlways keep in mind your standard SEO practices when it comes to posting your finished product. Make sure all of the necessary fields are filled and focused on the targeted keywords.\n\nPut important keywords at the front of your video titles, and include them in your description and tags. Do not overdo it, just put keywords that are relevant and are backed up by your research.\n\n**Use the \"Featured Videos\" section**\n\nIf you are certain that your video will be a major hit, use YouTube's paid \"Featured Videos\" service to get your video seen by many people in a short amount of time.\n\nOnce the video takes off, your organic traffic will usually out-do your paid traffic. Just as you can pay to increase your chances of coming up when people search for you on Google, you can up your odds with your videos as well.\n\n**Insert links in your videos**\n\nUse annotations to insert links to other videos to maximize every viewer. These can pop up throughout the video and lead audiences to another video, or even your website and blog. However, do not overdo this either. Make sure that annotations do not impede the viewing experience.\n\nIf you have one video that you want to concentrate on driving views too, use YouTube's InVideo Programming to add a featured video overlay. Also, make sure to include a branding watermark so that people can easily navigate to your YouTube page.\n\nThere is a lot of potential that lies within just one video when it comes to additional navigation options. Analyze which ones would make the most sense for your business, and be sure to take advantage of them.\n\n**Interact with high-value users**\n\nFind users on YouTube who are active and adding value through their participation in the social network. Get your video in front of them - without spamming so that they can do part of the work for you.\n\nYour video will also benefit with more traffic thanks to increased comments. YouTube will soon be implementing new features to increase the amount of social interaction on the website (for example by making it easier to find your friends)\n\n**Use social media**\n\nWith built-up and relevant social media accounts, get your video seen by more people. By \"relevant\" I mean that your friends and your user history should be somehow related to the topic of your video for it to get more qualified traffic.\n\nMy favorite sites for video sharing are Digg, Twitter, and StumbleUpon. Now that Google+ is integrated into YouTube it is fairly simple to reach out to people who might enjoy your content.\n\n**Rinse, wash, repeat**\n\nGo back and start over. Look at what you can improve about your video production and continue to keep your video channel page fresh with more videos! To learn how YouTube counts video views check out this previous blog post.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThere are many top YouTube marketing applications but choosing the right one can be difficult.\n\nYou need to choose an application that is not only affordable but also feature-rich. Keeping this in mind, here is the best YouTube marketing application for you Traffic Jeet!\n\nIt’s an amazing 6-in-one app that will do everything for you related to YouTube marketing.\n\nI hope this helps! :)",

(2022, Hubspot) \n* 48% of marketers believe video integrations into websites improve Search rankings. (2023, Mcuser) \n* Marketers focus on Repurposing of long-form content like Webinars &amp; live events to create B2B content for Tiktok or Youtube. \n* The marketers shifting focus from KPIs like Views &amp; impressions to Direct traffic deriven by Video. (Vidico) \n\n#2. insights from CMOs at Fortune 500 regarding ChatGPT \n\n1. Most CMOs believe that ChatGPT will have the most impact regarding content creation and management. \n2. The impact of ChatGPT will be the least on Brand Strategy &amp; tactics. \n3. The second most impactful role ChatGPT plays is regarding market research &amp; competitive Insights. \n4. The response from CMOs regarding Impact on Marketing Tools &amp; Customer Service is neutral as the it will take time to impact the usage of new tools. Also, their current marketing tools in usage are implementing AI slowly, making the decision of shift to new tools harder. \n\n#3. How Consumers Behaviour is Changing \n\n1. People want brands to show they listen 93% of them believe that brands should react to public opinion. (2023, ruderfinn) \n2. Why Consumers are abandoning purchases: 37% limited payment options, other 37% due to poor navigation and layout. With 33% leaving due to slow speed. (2022, storyblok)\n3. Users are spending lesser and lesser time reading your emails. The average time dropped from 13.4 to 9 seconds. (2023, litmus) \n\n#4. Social Media Engagement is Dropping \n\n* Instagram engagement rates across all industries fell by 30% last year. \n* Tweeting frequency was also down by 20% &amp; engagement rate growth was flat for Twitter. \n* Comparing to Post frequencies, Tiktok is still at the bottom. Brands are posting less frequently on the platform comparing to FB, IG &amp; Twitter. But the engagement rate is still highest among all platforms. (2023, RivalIQ)\n* Gen Z Tiktok User are 1.2x more likely to DM brands after making a purchase. (New Feature: You can open Tiktok DMs for everyone to message) (2023, Tiktok)\n\n#5. My Key Insights from Advertising Research on Brand Awareness \n\n1. In her study of the U.S. personal computer industry, Sovinsky Goeree finds that traditional demand models overstate price elasticities because they assume that consumers are aware of – and hence choose among – all brands in the market when in actuality most consumers are aware of only a small fraction of brands.\n2. How Advertising Patterns &amp; Practices deliver signals to Consumers can positively shape perceptions about the quality of the brand. The more volatile and inconsistent a brand’s advertising pattern is, the less impact it’s advertising expenditures will have on perceived quality.\n3. Our main finding is that advertising expenditures have a significant positive effect on brand awareness but no significant effect on perceived quality. These results appear to be robust across a wide range of specifications. Since awareness is the most basic kind of information a consumer can have for a brand, we con- clude that an important role of advertising is information provision. On the other hand, our results indicate that advertising is not likely to alter consumers’ quality perceptions.\n\n**You can [subscribe here](https://jaskaransaini.com/thesocialjuice/) to receive marketing reports &amp; news every week for free, with no BS.**",

      "selftext": "I run a small eco-friendly kitchen product store, and when I first started doing email marketing, I had no idea what a \"good\" open rate was. I’d hear people mention 20% and think, “Is that good or bad?”\n\nFrom what I’ve learned, a typical open rate for most industries is between 15-25%. For an e-commerce business like mine, hitting around 20% is solid, but I wanted to do better.\n\nAt first, my open rates were pretty disappointing—around 10%. So, I started making a few changes to improve things. Here’s what worked for me:\n\n1. **Clean Your Email List -** I use **Warpleads** to export unlimited leads, and **Millionverifier** to check if those email addresses are valid. If your list is full of bad emails, your open rates will tank. Cleaning it up was the first step.\n2. **Make It Personal -** At first, I sent generic emails, and they didn’t do well. Now, I try to personalize them—like addressing people by name and offering tips or sneak peeks, not just product promotions.\n3. **Timing is Key  -** I also figured out that sending emails on Tuesdays or Thursdays around 10 AM worked best for my audience. It took some testing, but finding the right time made a big difference.\n4. **Subject Lines Matter -** I realized my subject lines were boring. Instead of “New Products In Store,” I tried something like “Want a Greener Kitchen?” It felt more engaging and helped boost my open rates.\n\nAfter 3 months of tweaking things, my open rate went up to about 22%. It wasn’t instant, but it definitely paid off. I’m just at the point wherein I’m not sure if I’m over-testing them. How much testing is too much? When do you stop tweaking and just roll with what works? At this point, I’m hitting a solid 20%, but I feel like I could still do better.",

You’re Just Looking For Easy Money\n\nYou saw some flashy ass guru on YouTube saying blogging is passive income on steroids... and AI made it easier.\n\nNewsflash: it’s not. \n\nBlogging is hard, upfront grind. If you’re allergic to patience and think money will start raining on you in the first month, save yourself the heartbreak.\n\nBlogging is more marathon, less lucky lottery ticket.\n\n\n2. You Hate Writing (or Learning)\n\nYeah, I know, AI can help, but it won’t magically turn you into someone who loves creating content. \n\nIf you hate the thought of writing a 1,500-word article or tweaking it to rank on Google, blogging is going to feel like slow torture... seriously pull your toe nails instead.\n\nAnd if you’re not willing to learn SEO, strategy, or how to engage with readers? Forget it.\n\n3. You Have Zero Patience\n\nIf waiting six months (or longer) for decent traffic sounds like a nightmare, don’t even start. \n\nBlogging isn’t a \"post it and they’ll come\" deal... this isn't a Kevin Costner movie (that should give you an idea of my age lol).\n\nYou’ll need consistency, smart strategies, diversification and time. \n\nLots of it. \n\nThe world doesn’t care that you launched a blog... so, you’ve gotta work your ass off to make them care.\n\nLook, I’m not here to crush dreams. \n\nIf you’re serious about this, awesome...\n\nYou’ve already dodged most people’s mistakes just by being realistic. \n\nBut if any of these hit too close to home?\n\nSkip the blog and do something else that actually fits your personality.\n\nPeace. \n\nRL.",

Be patient.\n\nNot sure what you’ve heard but figuring out how to make it affiliate blogging (or any way) takes time. Prioritize your mental health and only take on what you can reasonably handle. You’re in this for the long haul.\n\n2. Habits are better than inspiration.\n\nHaving ideas is great. But generating ideas and actually creating content takes habits. Figure out what works for you. For me it’s 30 minutes on Monday thinking/generating content ideas and 30 minutes each day writing.\n\n3. Start multiple blogs.\n\nDouble down on what works. Don’t be afraid to start multiple blogs if you have the time. If you start seeing early signs of success, double down on it.\n\n4. Don’t neglect distribution.\n\nI was waiting on SEO for too long and I almost gave up. There are other methods of distributing your blog. Start early on repurposing your content on Pinterest, LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit or wherever - you’ll be surprised how much traffic you’ll be able to generate.\n\nHope this helps someone\n\n\nEDIT\n\nSince I’ve gotten a bunch of DMs asking about distribution - I’m [linking a tweet of mine here](https://x.com/2whazzuup/status/1967711437578703001?s=46) ",

Today marks exactly ONE YEAR since I launched my blog (April 28, 2024), and what a rollercoaster it's been! I wanted to share my journey, the wins, the setbacks, and everything I've learned along the way.\n\n# The Numbers (Because We All Love Data)\n\n* **Total Posts:** 55 (averaging about 1 post per week)\n* **Total Search Clicks:** 561,000 (yes, over half a million!) ([Click here](https://imgur.com/HWw8Xr8))\n* **Total Impressions:** 7.06 MILLION\n* **Total Earnings:** $4,000\n* **Highest Monthly Revenue:** $1,067 ([Click here](https://imgur.com/a/S4L9DSA))\n* **Current Daily Traffic:** \\~500-600 clicks ([Click here](https://imgur.com/a/LNUDnKk))\n\n# Month-by-Month Breakdown\n\n**Month 1:** Pure hustle mode - published my first 5 posts with absolutely zero traffic\n\n**Month 2:** The magical moment I got my very first Google search click! I literally celebrated.\n\n**Month 3:** Hit the 100 search clicks milestone and started believing this could work. ***(You can review my earlier posts to see my blogging report that I previously added to this community.)***\n\n**Months 4-6:** This is where things went CRAZY. Somehow hit 100K search clicks by the 6-month mark. I still don't know how it happened so fast, but I kept publishing consistently.\n\n**Month 7:** Got accepted into Journey By Mediavine! Finally started monetizing all that traffic\n\n**Month 8:** Peak performance - hit 10K clicks in a single day and was averaging 4K+ daily clicks\n\n# The Plot Twist\n\nDecember came with an unwelcome surprise - Google's Spam Update hit me HARD. My traffic tanked seemingly overnight.  \nI discovered someone had literally copied my entire blog and was somehow ranking ABOVE me on Google. Talk about frustrating!\n\n# The Comeback\n\nInstead of giving up, I focused on what I could control. By February, I started seeing organic traffic from Bing, Yahoo, and even ChatGPT (which was a nice surprise). While I'm not back to my peak numbers, I'm still getting a steady 500-600 clicks daily, which I'm grateful for. *(SS added above)*\n\n# What I've Learned\n\n1. **Consistency matters more than perfection**: 55 posts in a year isn't a ton, but being consistent got me here\n2. **Diversify your traffic sources** \\- when Google slapped me, other platforms saved my income: Facebook, Pinterest and my Telegram channel.\n3. **Content thieves exist** \\- protect your work and report plagiarism when you find it\n4. **Celebrate the wins** \\- from first click to first $1K month, every milestone matters\n\n# What's Next?\n\nI'm focusing on creating even better content, exploring new traffic channels, and hopefully hitting the $2K/month mark by the end of year two!\n\nA few more blogs have been started; I will talk about them later.\n\nFor those just starting out, just keep pushing. I went from zero to $4K in a year with just 55 posts. If I can do it, you absolutely can too.\n\nHappy to answer any questions in the comments!",

      "title": "To all the bloggers wondering if it's worth it. It is",
      "selftext": "This is a message for all my fellow bloggers that I wanted to share with you.\n\nI started creating content in early 2023 but not with blogging. At first I tried YouTube and TikTok, thinking that was the best way to share my contents. But I quickly realized video content wasn’t for me it. So I switched to blogging. I liked writing. It wasn’t easy, but I liked the research around a topic and then working on it until there's a final article. I realized it was very rewarding.\n\nThe issue is I wasn’t consistent. I had a job, and I was only covering a small part of my niche. Then in beginning of 2024 my contract ended which gave me more time to focus on my blog. I published here and there but I also remember thinking, should I really continue ? Then time passed, still no job so this summer, I made a decision: I was going all in. I expanded my content, covering news, trends, and events. My goal was to become of the main source of information in my niche. By August I started writing daily and mainly news.\n\nI also made another big change: I switched from Wix to WordPress. Wix was great as a beginner. But over time, I realized it wasn’t professional enough for what I wanted to build. I knew I needed something more polished if I wanted to be taken seriously and be seen as a true source in my niche. So I switched to a WordPress template and it made a huge difference. People are subscribing to my newsletter much more and I received a lot of compliments about it. Having a website that looks professional matters. If you want to grow and be perceived as an authority, your site should reflect that. \n\nOne of the biggest reasons I decided to expand my content was because I saw an opportunity. When I looked at my niche, I realized there were only about five french websites in my industry targeting a B2B audience. There was content out there, but very little that actually provided insights and deep analysis for professionals.I think this is something bloggers should think about. If you want to stand out and grow, select your niche carefully. Topics like finance, health, or cooking are great, but they’re also highly saturated. In my case, I found a space where there’s demand, but not enough specialized content. \n\nAt first, it was rough. My first article was in October 2023, and until December, I barely got 10 or 20 clicks per month. But now I have 2 000 monthly visits. I wish I had more traffic sometimes but when you’re mainly covering news it's different. I focus on writing more evergreen content because they are bringing long-term traffic. Nevertheless sometimes a trendy news well referenced on Google can bring very high traffic, it happened twice. Overall for me today what matters most is being seen as a trusted source in my niche and not monthly views.\n\nWhen I started, I had zero knowledge about blogging. I didn’t know if it was even worth it. I knew nothing about SEO, refreshing articles, or building traffic. But I learned so so much here so I genuinely want to thank you all. \n\nNow things are moving forward. I was interviewed in a podcast, I was a moderator at an event, I had a partnership with an event in my sector, one of my competitor and leader in my niche has subscribed to my newsletter (I'm still wondering whether it's a good or bad thing haha).\n\nThat said I don’t see blogging as my main job yet. Making real money from blogging takes time, and I’m still looking for a job. It’s tough but while I search, I’m putting my energy into growing this blog (that I no longer call a blog but an online media, it sounds better).\n\nAs blogger we have to be patient. Unlike social media, blogging isn’t about instant results. It’s a long game. I’ve had articles sit there with no traffic, then suddenly out of nowhere, they start trending. You never know what can happen.\n\nBlogging is tough, but when the results start coming in, it’s so so so worth it.\n\nIf you’re struggling, if you’re doubting yourself, don’t quit. Keep writing. Keep learning. Keep going. You never know where it’ll take you.",

      "selftext": "I'm writing today because the sale of my niche site that I've been working on for the last 4 years has finally been paid out and this journey has come to an end.\n\nI wanted to share my experience of creating a niche site in the recent climate, as well as what decisions I made along the way. I know that for most people my site is unremarkable and the amount I sold it for is modest, but as a first time business owner who \"just started,\" with no other experience in entrepreneurship, internet or otherwise, I feel that this was an excellent learning experience and I'm proud of what I accomplished and achieved along the way. Hopefully this post is instructive and inspirational for those who are also first timers on a bootstrapped budget and want to know whether this is really possible for someone who, for all intents and purposes, doesn't really know what they're doing.\n\n**General stats upon sale:**\n\n* Sold for **$102,000**, listed at $145,626 (39x)\n* Monthly revenue **$4,450** and monthly profit **$3,735** (over 12 months)\n* Monetized primarily through AdThrive **(80%)**, with the remaining 20% comprised of digital products on Etsy, YouTube Adsense, Online Course (Teachable), and Affiliate.\n* Traffic sources were primarily through Google search **(71%)**, direct - email newsletter **(16%)**, and social media - Pinterest **(9%)**\n* When sold, I had 2 freelance writers, a Virtual Assistant, and Pinterest manager, and had outsourced almost all work except for the core craft tutorials that I alone could produce\n* The sale did not include my likeness, and also did not include the 2 book deals that I had signed and continue to work on\n* **The only money I ever invested into the business was $300 up front.** After that, I never spent a penny of my own money and only re-invested profits from the business (aside from sweat equity of course)\n\n***Year 1 ('20): Beginnings***\n\nI began learning my craft in January of 2020, and conceived the idea of trying out blogging on March of 2020, when I started creating and designing tutorials for my craft and posting them on Instagram. In June of 2020, I purchased my domain name, and bought a $300 course from a fiber arts blog that I looked up to about \"how to become a craft blogger.\" Keep in mind that I was a 20 year old at the time, to whom $300 was actually a substantial amount of money (I believe my bank account had about $800 in it around then).\n\n**Key skills gained in Y1:**\n\n* I became an expert in my craft! This seems like an overstatement, but during this first year I designed, photographed, sent out for testing, edited, finalized, and published so many tutorials, that I was able to iterate on my process and level up my professionalism. This helped me greatly when I reached out to brands, magazines, and eventually book publishers in Y2-4\n* I learned the basics of SEO and set up my blog — I ran into many technical difficulties, but my boyfriend was a software engineer and helped me with the backend.\n* I learned the basics of marketing and how to present myself on Instagram (photography is everything!), as well as managing an audience when I ran giveaways, Q&amp;As, etc\n\n***Y2 ('21): Slow Growth***\n\nDuring year 2, I continued my work from year 1, but just more efficiently and with higher returns. At this point, I was focusing really hard on creating good, original content with the goal of getting to Mediavine, but I was writing all the articles on my own so it was slow going.\n\nIt was about this time that I also got really into email marketing. I switched to Flodesk after hitting the maximum free number of subscribers on MailChimp (about 1000), and loved the beautiful templates. I optimized my sign up forms, ran several campaigns to build subscribers, and built out my welcome sequence workflows and ran several sales that generated a couple hundred dollars at a time. This was extremely exciting to me because at this point I had become pretty burned out on Instagram and was looking for ways to move away from social media — **I quit Instagram at the end of 2021, the source of the majority of my income so far (brand deals).**\n\nI also started trying to outsource low-level content to various places. I tried a few content mills during this time and it was expensive and not very high quality.\n\n\n\n||Total Rev '21|Avg/mo|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sponsored blog post|$ 6,200.00|$ 764.29|\n|Ezoic|$ 598.99|$ 85.22|\n|Etsy|$ 2,007.18|$ 278.38|\n|Info product - bundle|$ 657.19|$ 93.88|\n|Info product - Payhip upsell|$ 288.76|$ 41.25|\n|Magazine Commission|$ 645.00|$ 50.00|\n|Affiliate|$ 214.98|$ 30.71|\n|**Total Revenue**|$ 10,612.10|$ 1,343.74|\n|Total Expenses|$ 999.99|$ 142.86|\n|**Net Profit**|$ 9,612.11|$ 1,200.88|\n\n\n\n\n\n|Stats|Avg/Mo|Comments|YOY Change|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Traffic|27,193|Strong upward trend in winter as I expected (fiber arts is heavily seasonal)|\\+26,193|\n|Users|11,064||\\+10,000|\n|Instagram (Quit at end '21)|10,000 ish followers||\\+9,000|\n|Email Marketing - flodesk|3000 subscribers|Highlight was an event I ran where I gained 1000 subscribers in a day!|\\+2000|\n\n\n\n\n\n***Y3 ('22): Focus on SEO &amp; Mediavine!***\n\nThroughout 2022 not much changed in terms of revenue, but I was zero-ing in on my goal to reach Mediavine. The bulk of my revenue was still in commissioned posts for the brand. I was putting out a lot more high quality blog posts that ranked really well — a highlight was when I dug into an academic article and translated French, all in the pursuit of creating *original* content, and all that paid off when **I qualified for Mediavine in October of 2022.**\n\nQualifying for and being accepted into Mediavine was a huge turning point for me. It represented the goal that I had been working towards for 2 years at this point, and also tripled my revenue in one fell swoop. I went out to omakase to celebrate!\n\n||Total Rev '22|Avg/mo|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sponsored blog post|$ 3,806.00|$ 317.17|\n|Mediavine|$ 2,401.00|$ 200.08 (started in Nov)|\n|Etsy|$ 3,684.00|$ 307.00|\n|Info product - bundle|$ 277.00|$ 23.08|\n|Info product - Payhip upsell|$ 871.00|$ 72.58|\n|WooCommerce (personal e-commerce)|$ 309.00|$ 25.75|\n|Affiliate|$ 2,479.00|$ 206.58|\n|**Total Revenue**|$ 13,912.00|$ 1,159.33|\n|Total Expenses|$ 2,148.45|$ 179.04|\n|**Net Profit**|$ 11,763.55|$ 980.30|\n\n  \n\n\n|Stats|Avg/Mo|YOY Change|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Traffic|56,650|\\+30k/mo|\n|Users|30,410|\\+20k/mo|\n|Instagram (Quit at end '21)|10,000 ish followers|\\+0|\n|Email Marketing - flodesk|6000+ subscribers|\\+3000|\n\n***Y4 ('23): Fast Growth, Diversification, and AdThrive***\n\nI qualified for AdThrive in December of 2022 (on Christmas!) and was onboarded with them by February. This was incredible growth for me and was the culmination of all the SEO work I did in 2023.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, I embarked on a massive plan to scale up by hiring a total of 5 writers, and outsourcing Pinterest to a new VA. This increased my expenses by 10x, but I had seen that outsourcing had worked to get me onto AdThrive and I wanted to continue to grow.\n\nI had only been on Mediavine for 3 months, but from what I saw, it seemed like AdThrive provided a 30-50% bump on my revenue (in exchange for more intrusive ads).\n\nSeveral other things happened this year:\n\n* Chat GPT went mainstream in March of 2023, and that heavily rocked the MV/AT community. Personally, I began to feel some anxiety about generative AI, and started to look into sources for diversification.\n* I started filming YouTube videos in early 2023 and was monetized in August, to the tune of around $150/month right off the bat\n* In June of 2023, I created, filmed, tested, and published a beginner course on Teachable. I ran a pre-sale through my newsletter only and earned $800 in revenue before the course went live. This was very successful and I ran another sale around the holidays.\n* In the fall of 2023, a publisher reached out to me to write a book of tutorials in my niche. This was hugely exciting to me and one of my main goals that I had had from the beginning. I accepted the deal even though revenue was negligible and I knew it would be a time-consuming project (deadline mid 2024).\n\nHowever, in my personal life, things were going south quickly:\n\n* In July of 2023, I achieved my goal of replacing my income at my full time corporate job (&gt;4k a month net profit) and quit my job. This was hugely validating and one of my primary goals from the beginning.\n* However, in September, my parent had a second, much more severe stroke (similar to the one in 2020) that landed them in the emergency room for over a month. During this time I was the primary caregiver and power of attorney. Needless to say, I did not do anything productive for the remainder of 2023, even though my revenue/profits in Q4 were record breaking (hit 200k pageviews in Sept and 6k revenue in Dec).\n\n||Total Rev '23|Avg/mo|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sponsored blog post (ended in March)|$ 900.00|$ 75.00|\n|Mediavine (ended in Feb)|$ 2,975.00|$ 247.92|\n|AdThrive (start in Feb)|$ 36,633.00|$ 3,052.75|\n|Etsy|$ 3,699.95|$ 308.33|\n|Info product - Payhip upsell|$ 206.98|$ 17.25|\n|Teachable Course|$ 2,676.68|$ 223.06|\n|Affiliate|$ 787.56|$ 65.63|\n|YouTube|$ 762.43|$ 63.54|\n|Book Deal|$ 375.00|$ 31.25|\n|**Total Revenue**|$ 49,035.80|$ 4,086.32|\n|Total Expenses|$ 9,641.51|$ 803.46|\n|**Net Profit**|$ 39,394.29|$ 3,282.86|\n\n|Stats|Avg/Mo|YOY Change|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Traffic|152,733|\\+100k/mo|\n|Users|82,272|\\+50k/mo|\n|Instagram (Quit at end '21)|10,000 ish followers|\\+0|\n|Email Marketing - flodesk|12,000+ subscribers|\\+6000|\n\n***Y4.5 ('24): Passive Income + Sale***\n\nGiven the family medical crisis that did not/has not abated, I was unable to work on the site, which caused me considerable stress. Even though it was cashflowing enough to more than cover all my expenses, my site was hit in the March update (had never been hit in an HCU update). Additionally, Google rolled out their AI snippets and I was aware that I needed to take action to continue growing.\n\nDuring this time, I was also working on my book project and taking care of family (e.g. fighting insurance companies, hospitals, and assisted living facilities).\n\nI made the decision in April of '24 to list the site on Empire Flippers since my traffic had been falling steadily (down to about 100k pageviews a month in April). Empire Flippers was incredible to work with and made the entire process so easy for a first time business owner. I received an offer at 70% of the valuation within a week, I did some negotiating to increase the up front payment, and it took about a month until the close.\n\nInitially, I was hesitant about forking over a full 15% of the sale price to a broker, but after this experience, I've realized that the value Empire Flippers provided was truly invaluable and worth every penny. If I could do it again, I would go with EF 100% of the time. The last reason I found EF to be so helpful is that they administer the migration, which actually took almost 3 months (very unusual for a business this small), mostly due to a disorganized and slow to respond buyer. Without a broker to add a little extra pressure, it would've been very stressful for me to push the buyer when I needed their go-ahead to get the funds released to me from the escrow account.\n\n**Overall Thoughts post Sale:**\n\nI feel very happy with the result I got with the sale. As the year progressed in 2024, it became increasingly clear that I wasn't going to have the time to devote to the business like I had in previous years. It also became clear that I **didn't really want to continue working on it**. This is mostly because of the anxiety that came with AI, as well as general burnout from managing a business where the win conditions are moving targets.\n\nIn the last 4 years, Instagram has completely changed and the strategies I used to grow rapidly in 2020-21 are completely obsolete, and the SEO tactics I used to grow rapidly in 2022-2023 are likely going to be obsolete in the near future. Additionally, a big part of the burnout was the fact that **trends changed rapidly in my niche**, with a new style of craft that I personally did not like absolutely dominating. It was very exhausting to stress about whether I should make a new project in the new style versus the one that I personally preferred, for years on end. This was part of the reason why it was a welcome relief to work on a years-long book project, where all of my projects (in the style I preferred) were set in advance without the need for my deliberation.\n\nTikTok was also a huge reason for burnout - I never got on TikTok, but the effect it had on other social media like Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest was very stressful to me as someone who does not like creating short form video content.\n\nIn the future, I'm definitely planning on pursuing entrepreneurship again, though perhaps through a high value service based business rather than a model of mass content creation. I also deeply value the book deals I got and continue to work on (just signed the second book deal a month ago) because it allows me to continue pursuing my craft creatively even past the sale of my business.\n\nIn addition, through the sale, I essentially earned over 2 years of net profit from my business all at once. Personally, I don't believe I would have been able to sustain the business at its level throughout the next 2 years (who knows what the online publishing space will even look like at that point), so it felt like a good payout to me. Most importantly, it gave me peace of mind while I continue to attend to family matters without having to stress about pageviews and volatility in the SERPs.",

For 2025 I've identified what my site will *actually* be about (there's some disjointed stuff on there now), and I'm excited to make that message clear and focus on it. And it's a topic I love! So I'm pumped to push it harder.\n\nEven though I made much more money, I actually (embarrassingly) only added 22 posts in 2024. But in July 2024 I finally started looking for larger affiliate programs after seeing which content was doing well and feeling like I had a solid foundation.\n\nI haven't used display ads and don't plan to, so all this income is from affiliate programs.\n\nLots of positive momentum in 2024, and I'm excited for 2025 (especially with posting more than 22 times...).\n\nHappy to answer questions and discuss.\n\n**Some things I believe...**\n\n1. You might not have your niche right away. That's fine. Start writing, build internal links, and you'll find your style/topics. Just start!\n2. Make sure your site is very user-friendly. I didn't mess with many affiliate links until I was hitting about 5,000 users per month. I don't use display ads because they annoy me when I have to close them on other peoples' websites.\n3. Find a few high-earning affiliate products and make all your content 3 degrees of separation or less from those products. This will be a big focus for me in 2025.\n4. Network! I need to practice this. In 2025 I want to get some quality backlinks from other travel bloggers/sites.\n\n|Month|Affiliate Income|Google Impressions|Users|Post Count|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Jan '24|$6.82|63,200|1,184|64|\n|Feb '24|$11.21|64,000|1,210|64|\n|March '24|$14.70|111,184|2,297|64|\n|April '24|$31.00|156,000|3,534|65|\n|May '24|$12.94|181,363|4,355|66|\n|June '24|$25.78|256,691|5,884|70|\n|July '24|$191.26|304,505|7,090|75|\n|Aug '24|$1,544.09|327,074|7,315|76|\n|Sep '24|$3,109.93|287,011|7,091|77|\n|Oct '24|$2,282.53|310,883|7,290|81|\n|Nov '24|$1,460.00|390,880|8,252|86|\n|Dec '24|$1,244.36|383,999|6,737|86|\n|**Totals**|**$9,934.62**|**2,863,790**|**61,234**||\n|2023|$44.73|158,633|\\-|\\-|",

It requires a level of discipline, patience, and persistence that many people just don't possess. We're conditioned to expect instant results, like a paycheck at the end of the week.

      "selftext": "Hey, everyone. I’ve been writing content for over a decade online. I do just about everything; writing blog posts is my favorite, but I also do plenty of website copy and ad copy. I ghost write almost everything; it’s very rare for me to have anything published under my own name (which is the way I like it).\n\nAt any given time, I usually have between 10-20 clients, and work 40+ hours a week. Whenever possible, I aim for long-term work. That is the key to getting out of the feast or famine “business model” (let’s face it—feast or famine isn’t really success) of being a freelancer. I've also experimented beyond freelance writing, but continue to focus on writing as my primary source of income. \n\nOver the years, I have experimented with a whole lot of different platforms to find work, some well-known, others not as much. As a writer, your job should be writing and getting paid, not scrambling around searching desperately for clients. In the hopes that this helps some people earlier in their freelancing careers, I’ve put together a run-down of all of the freelance platforms I’ve used and their pros and cons.\n\n# The Best Freelance Writing Platforms (and Alternatives):\n\n# Upwork:\n\nIf there is just one name that springs to mind in freelancing, it is probably Upwork. On the plus side, there are many millions of active users, so you can find a ton of potential clients and gigs on this site. If you get to be really skilled at bidding and/or find some repeat clients, business can be good.\n\nThere are downsides, however. Competition is fierce. You need to pay for “Connects” to apply for gigs beyond the first few each month. There are also hefty commissions (the fee can range as high as 20%). I originally started on UpWork, but the nickel and diming for everything now has pushed a lot of the better freelancers and clients out. \n\n# Facebook Groups:\n\nThere are a number of Facebook groups that function as marketplaces for freelance writing. Out of all of them, there are only a couple that I can really recommend. I have found some work through The Copywriting Job Hub. But the best one by far is Cult of Copy Job Board.\n\nRates are usually decent through these groups, and competition is not as intense as it is through a major freelancing site like Upwork or Fiverr. Some clients here do not really seem serious/ready to hire (they do not know what they want), but others are fantastic. Your best bet here is to wait for something in your niche to come along, and then apply. There is no middleman, no limitations and no fees.\n\n# Contra:\n\nRelated to finding jobs off of traditional freelance sites is Contra. Unlike Upwork, Contra charges zero commissions, and you can submit proposals to jobs for free. That means you can apply to as many jobs as you want, and keep more of the money you earn. If you want premium features such as advanced portfolio customization, you can pay for Contra Pro (basic Contra is 100% free). Basically, it works similarly to UpWork but with greater focus on North America based employers that tend to pay better + no fees. \n\nIt has all the major advantages of UpWork (ease of booking for clients, portfolio, reviews, etc. in one place), but lets you offer all of that without fees. I use it as my primary platform for clients I get directly. I still get clients on UpWork as well, but if you have a solid portfolio I'd highly recommend Contra as it avoids the lowballing of UpWork. \n\nAny downsides? First, it's heavily focused on US based employers and most of the clients I've seen have been tech or startup related.  If you don’t have a portfolio or writing to show clients, you’ll likely have a harder time than Fiverr/UpWork as you can’t bid under $25/hour. Overall, there are less clients than UpWork for the same reason. I can’t speak to that myself as I joined with a fair bit of writing experience, but if you’re less experienced, I’d recommend using it alongside the others and seeing what works best for you. \n\n# Fiverr:\n\nAnother top site for freelance writers is Fiverr. Like Upwork, the biggest advantage of Fiverr is how big it is. Unlike Upwork, Fiverr does not have a bidding system. Whether that’s a plus or a minus depends on how you like to work, but I appreciate that it is less of a time sink (plus, I am not spending money on proposals).\n\nAlas, Fiverr is notoriously hard to break into because the competition is insane. I can confirm from my own experiences that this is the case. The market is flooded, and getting started is tough. Also, just like Upwork, Fiverr eats a chunk of your earnings through commissions. If you have a particular niche that you can turn into a Fiverr service (i.e. flat rate), it’s worth trying--just be sure to factor the fees into your rates. \n\nI can also see it working as a lead generation tool, where you'd offer a flat rate service to get client leads and then upsell them on an ongoing relationship. Just beware that Fiverr has rules against working with clients off-site, so be sure to factor in their fees.\n\n# Freelancer:\n\nLike Upwork, Freelancer.com is a site that has millions of active users. There are some things I like about it, like its on-page chat, competency tests, and flexible withdrawal options. And once again, you can find a ton of potential clients here.\n\nThere are some downsides. Just as on Upwork, those who pay the most stand the best chance of getting gigs. Also, I have not been too impressed with the quality of the gigs that I have found through this site.\n\n# PeoplePerHour:\n\nPPH is a UK-based platform that can be good for content writers. Over a million businesses are here looking for freelancers, and there is a quality matching system.\n\nThe pros and cons are very similar to Upwork, actually. Just as I have found some decent jobs on Upwork, I have found some through PPH. But the fees on PPH are similar to those on Upwork, and once again, you have a limited number of free proposals you can make each month.\n\n# Forums:\n\nOne more solid option for finding freelance writing work that is often overlooked is through web forums. Examples include affiliate marketing forums like BlackHatWorld, Builder Society and Digital Point, as well as niche forums for webmasters.\n\nThis has been one of the best channels for me to find work. Costs are minimal, and I do not have to waste time writing bids/proposals. You can find quality, long-term clients on forums without paying commissions, and you can communicate outside the forums if you want. The biggest downside is that you will not get a ton of leads as most potential clients are spending all their time on big freelancing sites. So, alas, they are just as likely to overlook forums as your competitors are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you guys have any other questions about where to find freelance writing jobs or anything else, let me know and I'm happy to help where I can.",

I’ve even been contacted by AI writer developers to test out and market their apps because of my writing niche (Web3, Crypto, AI) so I’m confident in my knowledge of their uses and limitations. I won’t be namedropping those here to avoid promos.\n\nTo you, AI writing assistant fearmongerer, and firm believer that the freelance writing career will be over in 2 years. Have you ever tried using ChatGPT and reading the things it comes up closely?  \n\nI know how to use the more complex prompts for these AI tools. I don’t just type “write an X word article about x topic.” I ask it to develop headlines, and synonyms or rewrite existing content in a celebrity’s tone and voice. \n\nI’m planning to release my AI prompt cheat sheet for newbie writers soon to understand the use cases and limitations of AI prompts realistically.\n\nAnd I’m telling you, ChatGPT is NOT ready to replace writers, nor are the other tools. They can be great as writing aid, but they aren’t powerful enough.\n\nThey won’t be in the next version, either. AI tools have difficulty identifying voice, tone, and sounding like a human. \n\nHowever, you can use these as a faster google. “Give me ten definitions on X” is much faster than searching ten definitions manually. It’s fantastic at that.\n\nClients are freaking out because of what they perceive as AI content. Agencies are between embracing them or fearing them like the plague.\n\nBut seriously, cut the fear-mongering. If this is your excuse not to start freelancing or quit freelancing, then I don’t think this is the job for you. You fear a tool that can enhance your writing (if used intelligently) instead of embracing it as an alternative.\n\nThanks for reading my rant!",

I’m not sure why it would “taint” my career as a writer but I already have a disclaimer on my profiles stating I do not use AI in non-AI work (and had it before I started checking out prompt engineering)\n2.\tNobody is forcing you to do this.

Like it or not, we are all (and I mean all in the broadest societal sense, not just those of us in this subreddit) going to have to reckon with the rise of AI.

I didn't see a major change in demand following the release of you-know-what in November 2022 and thought I might be immune to technological disruption because I was at the high end of the market. But something happened over the past six months that killed my writing career. I'm guessing it was Google's search changes, but it's hard to say definitively.

I am sharing my story, hoping to inspire others who may be in the same boat as I was just a year ago.\n\n**In March 2022, I had never done copywriting in my life. I was a 50-year-old screenwriter with a passion for advertising and marketing, but I needed to figure out how to connect with clients.** That's when I discovered Upwork, and I started taking on random gigs - from greeting cards and board game instructions to YouTube scripts and website copy. I taught myself how to write a blog, and I read a marketing book every single week. My goal was to get paid to build a portfolio, and within a short time, I listed my rate at $75 an hour.\n\nI also wanted to legitimize myself as a freelancer, so I built a great-looking website. I bought a template and hired a web developer off Upwork for under $300. I got my portfolio items up and running, and I was ready to go.\n\nAfter eight months on Upwork, I made 15K, but I burned out on the process. I would apply for 30 jobs and only hear back on one. Plus, the stress of constantly missing new job opportunities or having a day without work was killing me.\n\nThat's when I focused my efforts on getting a long-term gig. I signed up for all the major job sites but discovered that LinkedIn offered the best opportunities to get noticed. At first, I got little traction, but I continually refined my resume and LinkedIn profile. As a writer, I realized I had a skill that could improve my situation.\n\nI also concluded that I could spend an hour applying to twenty $100 jobs on Upwork or an hour applying to twenty 50k to 100k jobs on LinkedIn. The choice was obvious.\n\nOnce I prioritized LinkedIn and optimized my resume and profile, I got traction. Recruiters reached out to me directly for jobs that weren't posted yet. I interviewed for several jobs, but the fit wasn't right. However, I took every single interview offered to improve my skills.\n\nAfter a few months of interviewing, I landed my dream contract job! I just started writing for a top telecommunications company, fully remote, for 125k a year.\n\nSo, to all the writing freelancers, keep pushing to learn more and try new things.

Took me an hour or two?\n\n- Started designing branded infographics on Canva to complement certain sections of my blog posts (literally asked ChatGPT for ideas, put it to life, slapped the client’s logo and website on the bottom right). I was naturally a creative and visual person, this came pretty easy.\n\n- Added tables and diagrams to my blog posts to make content more digestible \n\n- Designed attractive and attention-grabbing CTAs for them. I’m a B2B writer which means every single piece of content I write has a dual purpose: to educate and to sell something. \n\nSo I practiced copywriting alongside standard content writing. \n\nBut wanna know something I found out about the point above? There’s a huge disconnect between the writers and developers on CTA implementation - like where it should be placed and where it should go. \n\nI closed this gap by using ChatGPT as my personal developer/designer. Here’s what I did - and you can replicate this process for quite literally any task or function -\n\n1. Took a screenshot of an example CTA / image / design I liked and fed it to ChatGPT 4.0\n\n2. Asked it to create the code that would allow me to add it as an interactive element on the website (if it was a CTA, I also provided the end URL that the button should take the user too) \n\n3. This is what was game changing for me. I discovered a tool called codepen which basically lets you preview what the code is supposed to look like. So, without actually knowing how to code, all I did was paste the generated html from ChatGPT to codepen and made comments based on the visual preview.\n\n4. I literally took a live screenshot of the preview from codepen, fed it to ChatGPT again, and gave feedback (e.g., “change the background color to green and align the button to the middle of the CTA box and change the copy in the button to “Try free for 7 days” and link to [URL]”) \n\n5. Repeated this until my CTA was perfect, then attached that final embed code to the end of my article for the client/developer team to then transfer to the website CMS.\n\n- Also bought a Surfer SEO subscription and delivered articles not through Google docs but Surfer draft links so clients can see all the keyword optimizations and SEO best practices I followed along with an SEO content score\n\n\nAnd you think my clients would ever choose someone else over me when they couldn’t do the above? \n\nAll of the above probably took me a grand total of 5-6 hours to learn and get the hang of. And my article production time is around the same because AI is helping me write faster but I’m using that saved time to make the above improvements to the content.\n\nLmk if you guys have questions happy to answer.

But, and I will say this again and again, businesses/clients, beyond very high end brands, DO NOT CARE. They have to put profits first. Small businesses especially, but even corporations are always cutting corners. \n\nPlease do not think you are immune to this unless you are the top 1% of writers. I just signed up for Doordash as a driver. I really wish I was kidding. \n\nI know this post might get removed and I’m sorry for contributing to the sea of AI posts but I’m extremely caught off guard and depressed. Obviously as a freelancer I know clients come and go and money isn’t always consistent. But this is hitting very differently than times I have lost clients in the past. I’ve really lost a lot of my motivation and am considering pivoting careers. Good luck out there everyone.\n\n\nEDIT: wow this got a bigger response than I expected! I am reading through and appreciate everyone’s advice and experiences so much. I will try to reply as much as possible today and tomorrow. Thanks everyone",

      "title": "4 lessons from my journey to escape the 9–5",
      "selftext": "A friend of mine invited me into this community, and I’ve really enjoyed reading both the wins and the struggles that everyone shares here. It reminded me of my own journey, and I’d like to share my story in the hope that it might inspire and support some of you on your path as well.\n\nA little bit about myself: I failed at multiple businesses, and even my first FBA attempt completely flopped. I made countless mistakes. But I’m grateful I didn’t give up because those failures became the foundation that eventually allowed me to build the life I want.\n\nHere are the 4 biggest lessons that helped me turn things around. This isn’t meant as a brag; I just want to share what I wish I knew earlier, in case it helps someone out there.\n\n**1. Don’t chase “new inventions.”** Early on, I thought I had to find the next big idea. But instead, I learned to use Helium 10 to spot boring SKUs with steady demand, usually sold by competitors who don’t optimize their listings (bad images, weak copy, fewer than 50 reviews). Those became my easiest wins. I also stick to products where the landed cost (product + shipping) is around $8–12, and I sell them for $35–45. In that range, I’ve consistently cleared 25–30% net margins even after PPC. Lower-ticket products rarely justify ad spend at scale.\n\n**2. Build strong supplier relationships.** I started sourcing on Alibaba like most beginners. But I quickly learned that the prices there aren’t always the best. Many “suppliers” are actually middlemen, and they can easily spot a newbie. They’ll often charge higher compared to going directly through someone with real relationships. After learning from a couple of mentors, I switched to working with a sourcing agent they recommended. That was a game changer. A good agent speaks the language, knows the culture, and has the relationships to negotiate better pricing and faster lead times. Sometimes the difference is night and day.\n\n**3. Treat your listing like your best salesman.** One of my early mistakes was underinvesting in my listings. At first, I hired cheap Fiverr gigs and even tried to take photos of myself on my phone. The result? People would click my ads, but bounce immediately. It’s kind of like dating, you can have the best personality, but if you don’t look presentable, you don’t even get a chance to connect. Your listing is exactly the same: it’s the only “salesperson” working for you online. Don’t cut corners here, invest in good copywriting, images, and videos. That’s where your ROI really starts.\n\n**4. Launch small and scale smart.** Another mistake I made was going too deep too fast. I once ordered 500–1,000 units upfront, only to find out the market didn’t want what I was selling. Liquidating that much stock almost killed my cash flow. Now, I start with 100–200 units, ease into PPC, and focus on getting 20–30 reviews before scaling. Yes, the unit cost might be slightly higher, but it’s a calculated risk. It keeps me flexible, protects my capital, and avoids the “all eggs in one basket” problem.\n\nAt the end of the day, these lessons helped me build and even sell one of my brands. I’m not saying I’m the best, I’ve made more mistakes than I can count. But these are a few that shaped me. I hope they help you avoid some of the same pitfalls. And if you’ve got your own lessons learned, drop them in the comments. I'd love to hear them, let’s share, fail, and grow together.",

      "selftext": "When we launched our first supplement SKU back in March 2021, we didn’t expect it to turn into one of our biggest growth projects. Fast forward 3.5 years later:\n\n30+ SKUs live\n5.5% TACOS maintained consistently\n29% net profitability\n$20M+ in sales over the last 12 months (35% YoY growth)\n\nAnd here’s the surprising part:\n\nMost people assume scaling in supplements is all about “spending more on ads.” But what actually worked for us was the opposite:\n\nRelentless focus on TACOS : We stopped obsessing over ACOS and only cared about blended efficiency. This shift alone saved us thousands per month.\n\nSKU Discipline : Not every product idea deserves a launch. We killed 7 products early that would have drained margin, which allowed the winners to scale faster.\n\nOperational Margins First : From day one, we tracked landed cost + fulfillment + returns at SKU level. If an SKU didn’t hit our 25%+ net margin target, it didn’t stay in the catalog.\n\nContent Before Spend : We realized listing quality (titles, bullets, images, A+ content) drove more long-term sales growth than just pumping ad spend.\n\nDeep Product Research :Before launching, we didn’t just look at BSR or revenue screenshots. We dug into:\nSeasonality trends over 2+ years\nReview gaps (what customers hated in top listings)\nCompetitor keyword depth (were they ranking only on 2-3 hero keywords or spread out across long-tail terms?)\nPrice elasticity (what happens if we price at +15% or -15% of market average?)\n\nOnly when the data + margins + differentiation opportunity aligned did we greenlight a product.\n\nPackaging &amp; Positioning : Supplements is a sea of sameness. We spent real time on packaging that actually stood out on the search page. Clear labeling, premium feel, and benefits highlighted front and center increased click-through and repeat purchase rate.\n\nThe result? Today our supplement brand is doing 7-figures a month while still staying profitable and cash flow positive.\n\nI’m sharing this because every week I see posts here of sellers frustrated with high ad spend, low margin, or stuck at $50k-$100k/mo. Been there. It sucks.\n\nIf anyone here is in that phase and wants to see what an actual breakdown of TACOS, profitability, SKU strategy, and product research looks like, I can share our exact framework (no pitch, just the numbers and what worked for us).\n\nScaling is possible -  but only if you learn to say “no” to bad SKUs and “yes” to profitability over vanity revenue.\n\nHappy to answer questions if anyone wants me to go deeper into:\n\nHow we maintain 5.5% TACOS in such a competitive niche\n\nHow we filter product ideas before launch\n\nWhat levers actually improved net margins\n\nHow packaging &amp; positioning helped us win clicks in a crowded market\n\nHope this breakdown helps someone here learn a thing or two they can apply to their own journey \n\nOpen to your questions",

      "title": "I wish more people could know abt these advice when sourcing in China!",
      "selftext": "Over the past few years, I’ve been running a small business based in China helping international clients source and negotiate low-MOQ products from China — toys, accessories, custom merch.\n\nAgain and again, people come to me after being burned, ghosted, overcharged, or simply overwhelmed by the sourcing process. The ecosystem is complex, opaque, and culturally very different. I wish more people knew how this really works before making their first deposit, so here are the hard truths (and survival tips) I’ve learned from the front lines and want to share with any entrepreneurs who want to do business in or from China:\n\n**1. “MOQ is negotiable”—if” you know when and how to ask.**\n\nThe MOQ listed on Alibaba or 1688 is rarely set in stone. But most buyers get rejected because they negotiate too fast, too aggressively, or without understanding local business culture. Here’s what actually works:\n\n* **Time your approach:** Reach out at the end of the Chinese workday (around 5–7pm local time). They’re more open to flexibility once the pressure of the day winds down.\n* **Frame it as a trial, not a low-volume order:** Say something like, “I’d like to test 50–100 units to check quality and feedback before placing a 500+ unit order next month. And here is my order volumes for the past few months... (show them your potentials would be more credible!) ”\n* **Be specific; show a roadmap.** Give them a reason to believe you’re scaling. Try to be as specific as possible here because vague language like “maybe more in the future” doesn’t work and may influence the BD specialist's ROI (they prefer not to waste too much time on you then).\n\nFrom experience: I’ve helped clients reduce their MOQ by **up to 80%**, even when dealing with larger factories. In some cases, I negotiated 50-piece trial orders with top-tier manufacturers — by emphasizing the client’s branding potential and future growth. This works because smart suppliers sometimes take **a short-term loss to secure long-term customers** — *if* you seem credible. On other occasions, Having a clear logo, real website, or even basic brand deck helps tremendously. Also, don’t underestimate the power of 拼单 (sharing the large quantity with another buyer; some factories may be willing to do this, but it also depend on the negotiation)—combining small orders across similar clients into one batch. This works especially well for standardized SKUs or seasonal products.\n\nRecently, I’ve also started asking my trusted factory partners to introduce me within their networks — and it’s worked surprisingly well for clients with small MOQs. When trust is already established, especially in a culture where *guanxi* plays a key role, things move faster and negotiations become much smoother.\n\nThe key is relationship &amp; negotiation, not pressure. Lead with long-term intent, and speak our language (both literally and culturally).\n\n**2. Always ask: “Are you a factory or trading company?” — sometimes you can tell from their language &amp; speed of reply sometimes you need to verify.**\n\nJust asking is not enough. Here’s how to check:\n\n* Search their name + 工厂 (“factory”) on Baidu/1688.\n* Ask for factory videos (look for machines, not office desks).\n* Look up their business license or ask for one. Check 工商系统 (Chinese business registry).\n* ⚠️ Trading companies aren’t always bad — but they should tell you upfront.\n\n**3. A cheap price today = an expensive mistake later.**\n\nDon’t skip the basics:\n\n* Always start with a **paid sample** or free -  depending on negotiation.\n* If scaling, do **on-site quality control** before final payment — ideally by someone who speaks the language, can do video/ picture verification &amp; even do commission-based QC\n\n**4. Know the culture of collaboration**\n\nMost first-time importers rely entirely on Alibaba, emails, or Google Translate. That’s exactly how you end up overpaying, getting ghosted, or receiving the wrong product. Here’s why email alone fails:\n\n* \\*\\*Suppliers prioritize WeChat relationships.\\*\\* In China, serious business conversations happen on WeChat or face-to-face communication. It’s faster, more personal, and gives you access to supplier updates, real-time photos, and actual decision-makers — not just junior sales staff handling generic email accounts.\n* \\*\\*You’re often not talking to the actual factory.\\*\\* Without local knowledge, it’s hard to know whether you’re dealing with a real manufacturer or just a middleman. A simple trick? Ask for their business license, factory photos, or video calls  and know what to look for.\n* **You need to speak the sourcing language.** Common terms like:\n   * 出厂价 (chūchǎng jià): factory gate price, excluding tax or shipping\n   * 含税 (hánshuì): tax-included\n   * 含运 (hányùn): includes shipping can affect your margin by 10–30%. Misunderstand one term, and your “cheap supplier” suddenly isn’t so cheap.\n* **Disputes are sometimes hard to resolve from abroad (sorry).** If a shipment goes wrong, having someone local — who speaks the language, knows the norms, and can visit the supplier if needed — often makes the difference between fixing the issue and losing thousands.\n\nIf you’re serious about long-term sourcing—especially with low MOQs, multi-SKU orders, or branded packaging — **you need someone local in your corner**.\n\n**wow more DMs than I expected, FYI:** As someone who went abroad to study in Canada and then returned to China as a first-generation e-commerce entrepreneur, I personally also help small brands, solo founders, and first-time importers cut through the confusion, verify suppliers, and negotiate smarter deals — avoid traps you could image with a very fair price. \n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n**Nov 5th updates:** Hey everyone, I honestly didn’t expect this post to bring so many messages and business requests. I’m currently fully booked with sourcing projects until the end of this year.\n\nBut I’ve packed my years of China sourcing experience for my foreign clients into a short, no-fluff guide — things like finding honest agents, QC traps, realistic MOQ, and real negotiation tactics...\n\nDM if you want it. It costs about a coffee ☕. Thanks everyone! I’ll try to answer as many questions as I can but time’s a bit tight, but I’ll do my best to get back to everyone to help with strategic sourcing.",

      "selftext": "Here are the latest results from a client I've been working with, along with key takeaways you can apply to your own Amazon business.\n\n**Client Background &amp; Results:**\n\nWe began working together in June, and within the first month, we grew from $18k to $31k in sales. By the second month, we reached $56k in sales. Our initial focus was on driving top-line revenue and building ranking in a competitive niche. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubhz863axlud1.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0edfcca61ab048d1508df719c2471d23c6c57434\n\nWe're looking to beat July's sales in October, and are set up good for upcoming Q4.  \nThe graph below shows downtrend since it's still middle of October.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ijmbusf0tlud1.png?width=1488&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e67b67ff9f2c8464b38db2046cb00c3f7babf0a4\n\n**Key Fundamentals You Can Apply to Your Amazon Products:**\n\n**1) Campaign Structure  -** 80% of the campaigns I manage are single-keyword campaigns—and for good reason. One of the biggest mistakes sellers make is mismanaging placements, which leads to inefficient PPC optimization. By structuring your campaigns this way, you can optimize placements more effectively (I've detailed this further in the post below).\n\n  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon/comments/1bw8y5d/many\\_amazon\\_sellers\\_mismanage\\_their\\_ppc\\_with\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FulfillmentByAmazon/comments/1bw8y5d/many_amazon_sellers_mismanage_their_ppc_with_the/)\n\n  \n2) **Budget allocation** - at least half of your budget should be focused on ranking campaigns targeting your most relevant keywords. The sales generated from these campaigns is what drives your organic growth.\n\n  \n3) **Wasted Ad Spend - a** common source of wasted ad spend comes from running too many broad or automatic discovery campaigns without proper negative targeting. To minimize wasted spend, limit your budget for these campaigns and implement strong negative targeting to keep waste at a minimum.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1b5ogluctlud1.png?width=1026&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94537d644bf5b999edef96857b7329b3413a82b3\n\n4) **Ranking Campaigns -** don’t be afraid to run ranking campaigns at a higher ACoS than average. For example, one of our campaigns ran at an \"unprofitable ACoS\" but helped us achieve strong product ranking and significant organic sales growth.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bfvkayaetlud1.png?width=1302&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=53e94b7cec7cded046c993157f49e59a2bac18d1\n\n5) **Bids &amp; Placements -** proper bid and placement optimization is the main lever in Amazon PPC. I recommend optimizing your ads 2-3 times a week and monitoring certain campaigns daily. Keep a close eye on your organic ranking and overall sales performance. Analyze weekly trends and adjust your campaigns accordingly.\n\n",

My freight forwarder confirmed the same info many of you already know, there’s no “magical solution” at the moment. The only thing we can do is wait and see what happens next.\n\nI want to share a PDF invoice for one container shipped from HK to the US. The invoiced price was $47,000 USD. On that amount, the confirmed 174% Trump Tariffs were applied, you can see how that looks on paper.\n\nRight now, I have around 4–5 months worth of stock sitting in warehouses, so I just topped it up slightly with this shipment. I don’t plan to ship anything else for the next few months until the situation clears up a bit, since the impact of these taxes is massive. All the prepared goods will stay in my HK warehouse until we get some clarity on where things are heading.\n\nSo for anyone sending me DMs, please don’t. I know just as much as you do. Everything is on hold with the Chinese freight forwarders as well, and most of them are convinced this won’t last long (at least not this ridiculous 174% tariff). There are some workaround routes via Vietnam that people have started using, but they’re very costly and, to be honest, not 100% legit. So if you’re a brand or company owner (not a small individual Amazon seller), I’d avoid that route.\n\nThat’s it for now, guys, now we just wait :(",

Then move into your living room. Then your kitchen.\nSqueeze every inch of your space. Don’t spend money on a warehouse when you don’t even know how much space you actually need yet.\n\nOnce you’re making around 2–3k net profit for at least 3 months, that’s when you can start thinking about moving out.\n\nWhen your whole house turns into chaos and you’re tripping over boxes just to get to your bed — that’s the sign.\n\nHere’s what I did next:\n\nI didn’t get a warehouse.\nI rented a storage unit.\nCubeSmart, Extra Space, whatever’s near you. You can get a 10x20 for around $400–$500/month.\n\nNo Wi-Fi? Use your hotspot.\nNo outlets? Buy a portable power station (around $500-800on Amazon).\nThat’ll power your printer, desktop, fan, and a few lights.\n\nI worked like that for months until I was making 4–5k net.\nReinvested every single dollar back into inventory.\nAmazon is a cash-hungry business. The more you put back in, the faster you grow.\n\nEven then, I didn’t think I “had a business” yet. I was just surviving.\n\nWhen I started doing 10k net for a few months, I moved into a short-term warehouse.\nI used ReadySpaces — month-to-month leases, forklifts, Wi-Fi, hand trucks, etc included.\nMy first space was 250 sq ft for about $680/month all in.\n\nOnce I passed 20k monthly net, I thought about signing a 2–3 year lease.\nGlad I didn’t.\nYou think you’re ready, but e-commerce changes fast.\nYou don’t want to be stuck in a lease that doesn’t fit your next stage — whether you need more room or less.\n\nShort-term leases are the move.\nYou can upsize or downsize anytime without penalty.\nThat flexibility saved me more than once.\n\nEven now, I still prefer flexible spaces.\nNo long contracts is the way. At least for the first two years.. \n\nHopefully, this post saves someone else from learning the hard way. \n\nCheers MF. Enjoy Q4. \n\nP.S. - this image was 18 months ago at a storage unit.",

When I launched less than a year ago, I knew nothing about Amazon beyond being a Prime customer. Now I’ve just hit $100k+ in monthly sales. I started out in the UK and expanded globally.\n\nA few things that worked for me:\n\n1. Pick a niche you understand. I created and tweaked existing products that I wished already existed. That made keyword research and product design much easier.\n\n2. Don’t cheap out on branding, packaging etc. I invested in packaging and clear positioning from day one. It made reviews and conversion rates much stronger.\n\n3. Ads = growth lever. I tested dayparting, exact match bidding, and validated conversion rates before scaling. At first I wasted money, but once I tightened it up ACoS dropped massively. AI is your friend here. Lots of free or really cheap options to tidy up your ads\n\n4. Know your numbers. Sales tax, VAT, import duties, and landed costs make or break margin. I learned this the hard way early on. Make sure you understand trade terms, DDP, DAP. Price compare and haggle haggle haggle!\n\n5. Customer feedback &gt; guesswork. Our best product idea came from someone emailing us on Amazon asking for a variation.\n\n6. Global expansion is so easy on Amazon. Make the most of it.\n\nI’m not saying this is “easy”… I’ve had plenty of sleepless nights with stockouts, accounting headaches, and ad spend black holes. But it is possible to scale quickly if you treat it like a real business, not a side hustle lottery ticket.\n\nIf anyone’s at the early stages and wants me to expand on something specific (ads, sourcing, listings, etc.), happy to share what worked for me!",

They operate in the United States and currently have eight SKUs with a net EBITDA of about 22 percent.\n\nWhen they first came to me, their growth had stalled even though they had traffic, a healthy ad budget, and a product customers clearly wanted. They originally tried me out for a month because I don’t charge for the first month of PPC management. They liked what they saw, and the real work began.\n\nThe first step was fixing the foundation. Before spending a single extra dollar on ads, I audited the entire listing structure. The issues were obvious. Inconsistent content. No clear articulation of the product’s unique strengths. No system for building reviews. Keyword placement that didn’t align with the way customers searched. Many sellers assume PPC is the cause of low conversion, but more than half of conversion issues come from the listing itself.\n\nOnce the listing was fully retail-ready, I rebuilt the entire advertising structure from scratch. Every campaign was assigned a clean purpose. Discovery for new search terms. Exact match for scaling profitable winners. Mid-funnel campaigns for retention. Auto campaigns cleaned and refined weekly. Strong negative keyword filtering to maintain efficiency.\n\nAlongside that, we ran continuous A/B tests. Not just the obvious ones like main image variations but also title formats, image sequencing, pricing tests, placement adjustments, bid rule refinements, and even the timing of budget distribution. None of these changes alone created a massive spike, but together they compounded month after month.\n\nThis brand didn’t have a demand problem. They had a scalability problem. Once the foundation was right and the advertising was structured with intention, the growth curve changed completely.\n\nEverything mentioned here is learnable and repeatable. A structured audit. Clear USP definition. Review system. Keyword alignment. Purpose-driven campaigns. Weekly refinement and testing. That is what moved the needle, not random bid increases or higher budgets.\n\nIf you fix the fundamentals first and build a system instead of reacting to problems, the results usually follow.\n\nA big amount of our sales have been coming from b2b campaigns, try them out, they’re really really useful (and ynderrated ) see you guys in FAT FIRE",

Because most people are naive, lazy, and think a few YouTube videos or a $500 course makes them an entrepreneur. Everyone wants “passive income” without putting in the years of grind it actually takes to build something real.\n\nFor every 100 people who buy a course, maybe one actually makes it. That’s why the “gurus” flex Lambos and screenshots — they’ve got thousands of students and barely any real success stories.\n\nAnd listen — Amazon isn’t what it used to be.\nOA and RA sellers are getting Section 3’d daily, brands are gating harder than ever, and seller support is absolute trash. Until your account health score is elite, Amazon will treat you like a cockroach waiting to get squished.\n\nBut if you still want to do it — go for it.\nJust go in with realistic expectations.\nYou won’t get rich quick. You won’t replace your 9–5 in three months.\n\nIt takes years to build a real seven-figure business.\n\nAmazon’s brutal. But if you’ve got grit, patience, and zero quit — it might just work..",

      "selftext": "You have a state that is deeply red where they already hold a supermajority, yet Trump is furious because they would not break democratic norms hard enough to hand him two extra seats he feels entitled to. Note the language he uses here. He is not saying the map was unfair. He is openly advocating for gerrymandering and threatening to primary a Senate leader for not being corrupt enough to pull it off. \n\nThis is the purity spiral in action. If you are not willing to dismantle the basic framework of democracy to serve his ego, you are effectively a Democrat to him. It is a cult of personality that demands total subservience over political strategy or basic governance. Rodric Bray is a staunch conservative, but because he had a shred of institutional respect left, he is now on the bad boy list, just like MTG. \n\nLoyalty is never enough for these people; you must be willing to burn down the house to prove you love the leader.",

      "title": "Stupid easy ways to land clients",
      "selftext": "You know what's funny?\n\nEveryone's looking for the \"secret\" to landing clients.\n\nLike there's some magic bullet hiding in the shadows that'll solve all their problems overnight.\n\nTruth is, most of the best client-getting strategies are stupid simple. So simple that people dismiss them because they don't feel fancy enough.\n\nBut here's the thing, simple doesn't mean instant.\n\nI've been doing this copywriting thing for years now, and I've tried just about everything to get clients.\n\nSome methods worked. Some didn't. Some took forever to pay off but were worth the wait.\n\nSo let me break down the strategies that actually moved the needle for me when I first started freelancing, starting with my favorite one.\n\n**Finding niche Facebook groups and becoming the helpful guy.**\n\nThis one's deceptively powerful. I'd join local and niche marketing groups, then camp out in the comments section. Not to sell anything. Just to help.\n\nMy goal was simple: get more likes on my comment than anyone else, including the original poster.\n\nHow? By giving away everything I knew.\n\nWhen someone asked about email open rates, I didn't just say \"try better subject lines.\" I'd break down the psychology behind what makes people click, share specific frameworks, give actual examples, etc.\n\nComments are beautiful because they don't feel salesy. If you're the top commenter, everyone sees you. And if you're consistently helpful, people start tagging you when questions come up. This creates massive social proof, and I was being referred to clients even by people who've never seen my work (but did read my comments).\n\nThis wasn't instant. I didn't land clients the first week. But over months, I became the go-to guy in those communities. That reputation was worth its weight in gold.\n\n**Applying to old job postings.**\n\nThis one sounds crazy, but stick with me.\n\nInstead of fighting for scraps on fresh job posts, I'd scroll back and find posts from 10+ days ago. Sometimes even 6 months old.\n\nThen I'd message them: \"Hey, did you ever find a copywriter for this project?\"\n\nMost had. Some hadn't. A few said they were always looking for good people to work with.\n\nThis worked way better than I thought it would. Why? Because the urgency was gone. No pressure. Just a friendly check-in that sometimes turned into real opportunities. \n\n I remember the first time I tried it, my 5th DM landed me a $3,000/mo retainer - crazy.\n\n**Cold outreach with a killer foot-in-the-door offer.**\n\nCold emails feel like shouting into the void. And honestly, most of the time they are.\n\nBut the ones that worked had one thing in common: a specific, low-risk offer that made it easy to say yes.\n\nI stopped pitching \"email marketing services.\" Instead, I'd ask something specific, like: \"Can I revive your dead list in the next 14 days?\"\n\nSpecific timeline. Specific outcome. Low barrier to entry.\n\nI kept tweaking these offers until I found ones that consistently got responses. This is probably the fastest way to get leads right now, which is why every freelancer needs to master it.\n\n**Creating a digital product.**\n\nThis one's definitely not easy, nor simple. It's actually unrealistic for most people, so feel free to skip it. I decided to include it anyway for anyone who's been freelancing successfully for a while and is looking to start consulting.\n\nI wrote a book on email marketing, built a full funnel around it with upsells, then ran ads. The funnel broke even - $1 in, $1 out.\n\nSounds terrible, right? But the people buying started asking for 1-on-1 coaching. That's how my consulting business was born.\n\nFair warning: this was a massive amount of work, and I had an unfair advantage since building funnels was my core service for years.\n\n**Actually asking for referrals.**\n\nThis one's so obvious that almost nobody does it.\n\nAfter hitting an emotional high with a client, (maybe we just launched a campaign that crushed it, or they got amazing results) I'd send a simple email:\n\n\"Hey, do you know anyone else who might need this kind of work?\"\n\nSome said no. Some said yes. Some ignored me until I followed up three times.\n\nBut every single freelancer should be doing this. It's the easiest ask in the world when you've just delivered great results.\n\n**Posting valuable content online.**\n\nLinkedIn, Reddit, and Facebook all work, but there's a catch: you need to know how to write content that gets engagement.\n\nOn LinkedIn, for example, this means writing lead-gen posts (those \"comment below to get my free XYZ\"). The goal here is to really give away everything you know. Yes, some people will go and do it on their own, but lots of people would prefer just to hire you to do it for them, and giving everything away makes people feel like you're still hiding a vast amount of knowledge.\n\nThis works particularly well if you combine it with my next piece of advice:\n\n**The pitch document that works while you sleep.**\n\nI created a 4-page Google Doc with a bold promise, my step-by-step framework, case studies, and exactly what clients get when they work with me.\n\nThen I put the link everywhere. Email signature. Social media bios. Website.\n\nThis way, anything that brought people to my socials also passively pitched them. Got tons of clicks and interest without having to sell myself constantly. (Check my last post on r/copywriting if you want more details about this.)\n\n**The Amaretto Sour Effect.**\n\nThis one sounds stupid but works.\n\nI'd share random life moments on Instagram and Facebook stories. Having a drink (amaretto sour being my fav), trying a new restaurant, whatever.\n\nCan't tell you how many times clients replied with \"Oh, I just remembered I was gonna ask you about...\"\n\nIt's just a way to remind people you exist and that you're doing well. Sometimes that's all it takes. Just remember to add your clients and prospects as friends on Facebook and follow them on IG.\n\n\\--\n\nThe thread connecting all of these? Consistency and genuine value.\n\nNone of this happens overnight (cold outreach and job boards are the quickest). But if you stick with it, if you actually help people instead of just trying to sell them, good things happen.\n\nYour reputation grows. People remember you. And when they need what you do, you're the first person they think of.\n\nThat's worth more than any \"secret strategy\" you'll find.\n\nP.S. It's easier to share everything and focus on long-term growth if you have a regular income. So having a job that pays your bills and building a freelancing business on the side makes a lot of sense.",

If you want to freelance from scratch, I'd recommend trying to work for agencies as opposed to trying to find your own clients right out of the gate.\n\nIt's difficult to try to get a random business owner to take a chance on you when you don't have experience. It's still difficult to get agency owners to do so, but they can at least tell what good copy looks like. So if you create your own spec portfolio and have it ready to send, you'll have a shot at getting a chance.\n\nGetting clients early on is such a grind — work for someone who can get clients for you.\n\nHappy to answer any questions!

      "selftext": "Nicolas Cole is a popular writer online. He is active on Twitter and has written great books about writing.\n\nRecently, he opened a YouTube channel and posted a 32-minute video that was super valuable to me.\n\nI've already watched the video twice to take notes, and many of these tips were non-obvious. (I'll try to extract the best lessons from this video into an upcoming [newsletter](http://becomingacopywriter.substack.com) issue).\n\n**This was a true lesson in copywriting. I will return to this list often to apply these to my writing.**\n\n# Sharing my summary of the video:\n\n1. You are not selling anything -&gt; You give the customer an opportunity to change.\n2. Don't use formal language. Speak in a conversational tone as if talking to a friend.\n3. Use \"you might be experiencing\" instead of \"you are experiencing\" to address different problems.\n4. Avoid using the word \"better\" (and other ER words) to prevent comparison. Focus on what makes your offering different.\n5. Be a painkiller, not a vitamin. Frame your product or service as a solution to immediate pain rather than a preventative measure.\n6. Sell and emphasize the result, not the process.\n7. Write copy for one specific reader, not for a crowd.\n8. Don't sell the customer on your brand. Educate them on the category.\n9. Teach, don't sell. Focus on educating the customer about the problem and the solution.\n10. Never blame the customer. Empathize with them and pick a mutual enemy.\n11. Separate writing copy for insiders (those familiar with the industry) versus outsiders (beginners).\n12. Ground your argument in a shocking statistic whenever possible to capture attention.\n13. Use the phrase \"according to\" to add credibility to your writing.\n14. Organize information into lists to make it skimmable and easier to read.\n15. Don't oversell the problem. State it simply and clearly.\n16. Give your customers new language to talk about the new problem you're educating them on.\n17. Remind the customer what will happen if they don't take action.\n18. Emphasize the benefits, not the features of your product or service.\n19. Remove the fear of buyer remorse by offering guarantees or reassurances.\n20. Great copy doesn't read like a copy. It reads like a story or educational content that is engaging and helpful.\n\nThat's it!\n\nDid you find any of these tips helpful?",

We have connections in the industry. We have experience with big brands.\n\nNone of us (as far as I know) have paid to take a copywriting course with an online coach. \n\nNone of us use gig boards like Fiverr, Upwork, etc. \n\nNot many of us send cold emails to prospective clients (although some do).\n\nSome of us don't even have an online portfolio!

Jobs are just as competitive as freelance gigs. Some folks in certain geographic locations don't have ad agencies or big companies nearby who are hiring writers. \n\nAnd not every freelancer needs to do this to be successful. Some people go freelance from scratch, and they're rocking it! We all have our path.\n\nBut I believe that for most people, this is the single most important factor in lasting freelance success. \n\nCurious what you think!",

Edit into finished copy (hard/highly-skilled)\n\nAs you can imagine, I tend to procrastinate at steps 2/3. 🙃\n\nSo, I recently 'hired' two team members to handle this work.\n\n* Researcher — Google NotebookLM handles customer intelligence\n* Junior copywriter — my custom-trained Gemini Gem writes the first draft\n\nNow I can focus on steps 1/4 which are a much better use of my time and energy.\n\nMuch to unpack, but I just wanted to point you all toward the wonderful Notebook LM.\n\n**You can essentially build a customer intelligence LLM for every client.**\n\nNotebookLM is optimised for research.\n\nIt can store, organise and search through 50-300 sources:\n\n* PDFs (sales decks, reports, white papers)\n* Customer surveys/video transcripts\n* Project briefing documents\n* Website pages\n\n**IMPORTANT:** You should spend a while carefully organising your folder of sources before you upload them. Batch your filenames. For example, 'Sales document — Autumn Product catalogue.PDF'\n\nNow you can refer to 'sales documents' as a collective etc.\n\nNotebookLM has a high level of accuracy and low haullucinations — but (like most engineers) it's not a good copywriter. So I create insights and briefs that I feed into Gemini.\n\nI could write for days about the incredible things that NotebookLM does.\n\nBut I'll give you just one workflow to illustrate the point.\n\nI used to spend several days crawling through videos and interviews to find user testimonials that I'd edit by hand and organise in a spreadsheet against use cases.\n\nNow it takes 1-2 hours.   \n  \n1. Download and transcribe 40+ podcast episodes in which my client interviews their customers.  \n  \n2. Drop the transcriptions into NotebookLM.  \n  \n3. Ask NotebookLM to find every quote that describes the impact of our product on a customer's life and create a table with columns for quote, person, company, use case.  \n  \n4. Copy this table into Gemini. Ask my custom-trained copywriter Gem to convert these raw testimonials into case studies with a short title that starts with the company name and includes any metrics, plus a short paragraph of explainer copy underneath.  \n  \nBoom. 1-2 days of work done in under an hour.\n\nI am jumping around like a kid at Christmas.

See here.\n\nThat same week I got my first passive lead.\n\nI was working with a client on their website copy. Midway through the project, they replied to one of my emails with: \"Hey, I noticed you also do funnels. Is that something you could help us with, too?\"\n\nJust like that - an upsell I didn't have to pitch, for a client who discovered it themself.\n\nSince then, I've been using this everywhere from my email signature to my social media profiles.\n\nThe result?\n\nI haven't had to market, sell or pitch myself in the last 5 years.\n\nI'm just going through my life, sending emails as normal, writing a post every once in a while on LinkedIn, and I get leads constantly.\n\nThe fact that clients self-select makes this work 100x better than active pitching - there's like zero pressure on them.\n\nFor anyone wanting to try this:\n\nKeep it simple.

      "title": "Got replaced by AI. CEO regretted it and asked me back.",
      "selftext": "So, here’s a story about how I got replaced by AI and junior copywriters, only for my old CEO to come crawling back. Spoiler alert: I didn’t go back.\n\nI used to work as a copywriter for this company. The CEO decided to replace me with beginner copywriters and AI-generated content to save costs. He was convinced that AI tools like ChatGPT could handle everything, from blog posts to social media, without human input. I tried explaining to him that AI doesn’t always get it right, especially for niche industries or clients with physical products. For example, some of our clients sold stuff like electrical tools (wrenches, screwdrivers) or machine parts (bearings, etc.), and ChatGPT would often recommend the wrong products or include inaccurate details. Clients had to correct us all the time.\n\nI told him some tasks required real research and manual effort to ensure accuracy. But he drank the “AI can do it all” Kool-Aid and decided I wasn’t necessary. He even asked me to hand over my prompts. The ones I use to create engaging social media posts and blogs. At that point, I could see the writing on the wall. So, I only gave them a watered-down version of my prompts, keeping the advanced ones to myself. Here's a tip: Never give away your secret sauce. It’s your edge, especially in marketing.\n\nWhile training the junior copywriters, I pointed out that certain things needed to be done manually. Though some of those tasks could’ve been automated if you actually knew how to use AI properly. But I wasn’t wrong about one thing. To write well for a client, you need to understand their business and do real research, not just rely on ChatGPT to spit out content.\n\nFast forward to when the juniors thought they had my process somewhat figured out (spoiler: they didn’t). The CEO decided I was expendable and fired me. He went all in on cheaper labor and AI.\n\nI kept tabs on the company after I left and, honestly, the content they were putting out was embarrassing. The blog posts and social media were just... bad. The difference between my work and theirs was obvious. And the client got mad and asked for a refund.\n\nTwo weeks later, HR reached out to me. Apparently, the CEO realized his mistake and wanted me back because he was impressed with my results (the ones he’d taken for granted). I felt vindicated, but there was no way I was going back. By then, I had decided to go full-time freelance, and things were already looking up. I have two clients now and a potential third lined up.\n\nMoral of the story: Don’t let anyone devalue your work or your expertise. AI is a tool, not a replacement for skill, experience, and understanding. And never, ever hand over the keys to your kingdom.\n\nFYI. This whole thing I am writing is \"aided\" by AI. Take note, \"aided\" by AI, not generated by AI. There's a difference. What I am doing here is blabbing about whatever comes to mind and using GPT to restructure what I am saying. Most of this was me talking into the microphone, and GPT was used to refine my post. This is another way of creating a post. Say whatever you want and use GPT to restructure.",

      "selftext": "Here's an e-mail Tyson 4D (\"six figure copywriter\" and Andrew Tate student/follower) sent out about offering coaching. I'm gonna rip this sucker apart and tell you why you shouldn't by giving people like this money or publicity. (And yes, I see the irony in me publicizing an e-mail of his to tell you not to patronize or publicize him) EDIT: HE'S CHARGING $100 USD/mo WITH A $300 SIGN UP FEE.\n\n\"Most people know me as Tyson “FREE Value” 4D…\n\nI have dozens of YouTube courses to help you become a 6-figure copywriter.\n\nBut if you wanna get to $5k-$10k/mo ten times faster,\n\nHere’s the best way:\n\nQuestion…\n\nWhat do Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, And Jeff Bezos all have in common?\n\nAside from being some of the richest men in the world,\n\nThey all pay millions every year for people’s advice and insight.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause having someone in your corner is a business cheat code.\n\nWhile everyone else is concerned with “free, fast, and easy”,\n\nThe winners figure out how to get a competitive advantage.\n\nHaving a mentor is like having a 10 second head start in the 100m dash…\n\nSimply nobody can compete with you. It’s completely unfair.\n\nAnd that’s what I’m giving you the opportunity to do.\n\nIf you want to start working directly with me and the 4D team.\n\nReply to this email with the word “COACH”.\n\n(But ONLY if you're actually willing to commit to the work).\n\nMy team and I will get you up to speed with copywriting and show you the path to getting clients ASAP.\n\nBUT…\n\nI’ll only be answering emails for the next few hours, so don’t put off your reply until later.\n\nI'll see you in tomorrow's free value email. 😎\n\nTalk soon,\n\nTyson 4D.\"\n\nHe already claims his free videos which are already pretty useless are capable of getting you a 6 figure income in 90 days. Is he magically going to will his students get 6 figures in 10 days? Not only is that unrealistic, I'm certain that's downright impossible.\n\nNotice how he's using terms like cheat code and competitive advantage. This is how guys like this trick you into buying their snake oil. Any rational person who knows it's going to take them months, or much more probably years to develop the skills they need to make a reliable six figure income in any practice, let alone creative pursuits like copywriting. You know what gets in the way of our rational thinking? Emotion. As copywriters we're trying to trigger some kind of emotional response from our readers. You know what makes people really emotional? Fear and desperation. That's what sleezeballs like this take advantage of. Desperate or gullible (or stupid, though that's not mutually exclusive with being gullible). Let me put it this way, his videos get tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of views. His group on Skool has over 25,000 members. If even 1/10 of them signed up for a $5/mo course, he's making 150K for the year. Odds are he's gonna charge $15-20 on the low end if he makes a premium course, probably gonna charge hundreds an hour for 1-on-1 mentoring.\n\nThis is how people like this make their six figure incomes. They sell you really shitty advice that you can find for free elsewhere. Literally any piece of advice he gives you can be found with a simple Google search because he isn't a good copywriter. He's another hack following whatever e-mail templates he got from idiots like Andrew Tate. And he shows us how much he learned from Tate by using terms like \"winner\" to suggest that you'll be above all the plebians who didn't pay him. Well that and the fact he writes in several 2-3 line paragraphs and takes multiple lines to make even the simplest points.\n\nSeriously, many of the great copywriting books recommended on here are $10-15 for a digital copy. That'll go much further than paying some guy who can't write for shit gives you paid instruction.\n\nNotice how vague everything he wrote is. He's just trying to get hyped by saying it's basically cheating because he knows people are desperate for shortcuts. He doesn't even tell you what new things he'd be teaching you about which if you're trying to sell ***INFORMATION/KNOWLEDGE*** you should be trying to pique your reader's interest. There's a reason a lot of contractors, landscapers, cleaners, etc. will come down to give you a quote. They're creating perceived value acting like you're getting something amazing for free. Tyson's doesn't even propose he's got some super secret course. He just vaguely says his coaching will make you rich 10 times faster.\n\nPlease stop giving assholes like this money. What you'll pay for his shitty coaching will get you several of the best books on copywriting. Bly's *Copywriter's Handbook* and Sugarman's *Adweek Copywriting Handbook* are on Spotify as audiobooks. Listen to some of podcasts on Spotify.\n\nBut please for the love of God stop giving people like Tyson and Andrew Tate your hard earned money. You're basically throwing it away. And you'd probably make money faster panhandling in LA than how fast they're promising to make you money.\n\nYou're not going to make six figures in weeks or a couple months copywriting. The people who make that much have years of experience, work for major clients, agencies, or companies, and make a major part of their income off commissions or royalties. Not writing one-off e-mails for e-commerce companies.\n\nI'd say stay away from courses all together unless you're paying to learn from someone who is actually successful in this field and is qualified to coach you, but even they write those same books that get recommended on this sub.\n\nI've paid for some cheap courses on learning sites like Udemy and I can safely say it's all bullshit. They just give you the same useless formulaic crap that Tate and Tyson 4D give you. This is all stuff you can find for free, but these guys won't teach you how to actually come up with ideas for or write copy.\n\nRead copywriting books from great writers, read great copy (I'm working on a swipe file with some great direct response stuff), practice writing copy, practice writing informal essays, take notes by hand, listen to audiobooks and podcasts about copywriting, watch informercials and video sales letters (seriously, don't pay attention to the super wacky shit, but pay attention to how they explain the benefits of their products and craft offers), but don't flush your money down the toilet by giving it to these jagoffs. I've felt the need to apologize to people I let buy me shitty courses like these people sell as a gift (and those were one-off payments, not subscriptions).\n\nAnd again, I can't stress this enough, YOU HAVE TO ENJOY WRITING if you want to be a copywriter. You don't need to be amazing at it, I can't write narrative fiction to save my life. I'm great at the general brainstorming and planning, but when it comes time to put pen to paper (or fingers to keyboard), I can't write more than a few lines. But I've always been good at quickly writing essays. Practical writing where I'm trying to convince you of some sort of point. Maybe I'm trying to explain the themes in am Orwell novel, maybe I'm trying to sell you on getting the outside of your house pressure washed, or maybe I'm trying to convince you to wise up and not give attention to snake oil salesmen!\n\nDisclaimer: I don't know what Tyson 4D is like as a person, but in my opinion he is piss poor writer judging by his copy and I think his business approach is slimy. Same with Andrew Tate any other \"six/seven figure copywriter\" who is trying to sell you a course where they tell you to follow 3 or 4 formulae to write copy. Also stay away from courses on sites like Udemy. There are actual copywriting coaches out there like David Garfinkel (he's the only one I can think of right now), but they charge you something like $1200 up front, they don't squeeze several hundred to a couple thousand out of you over time.\n\n(I'll work on correcting any typos, I wrote this on my phone with more than half written while walking back from the vending machine like 4 or 5 minutes from my apartment.)",

      "selftext": "This isn't an easy post to write, but I feel like I have to. \n\nIn short: My position was just eliminated at my company. I'm only going to be working until the end of the month. So I'll need to find work again ASAP. \n\nIn long...I'm terrified. Absolutely gutted. Not just because I'm suddenly out of work again for the first time in six years, but because I don't know what I'm supposed to do now. \n\nI loved this job, I liked this company a whole awful lot, and I had hoped to stay there long enough to eke out something like a retirement from it. \n\nBut not now. All gone.\n\nI'm assured this wasn't performance-based. I was told it was for financial reasons. And I believe that. I've received nothing but glowing performance reviews and the maximum merit-based yearly wage increases during my entire tenure at this company. My soon-to-be former boss is a genuinely good guy, and has always been straight with me. He still was today. He was REALLY upset during the Teams call with HR.\n\nEven so, this job wasn't just what I did. It was WHO I AM. I've been writing full-time for 25 years. The last year and a half, I've been my company's Content Manager. But now, a craft to which I've dedicated my life is being taken over nearly wholesale by AI and content mills. And not just at in the global sense. That's literally what's happening at my company. \n\nI guess I should have seen it coming, though. I've been \"spearheading AI productivity initiatives\" for months. Creating workflows, writing out best practices documentation, and getting unqualified folks with no real copy or content experience trained up on our products in case we needed to give them \"overflow\". So I should have seen the (literal) writing on the wall in terms of training my replacements, robot and otherwise. \n\n(Not to mention that I've long worried that the classic Venn diagram of \"Cheap, Fast, Good: Pick Two\" would eventually bite me in the ass in a general career sense, since most of the decision-makers who wouldn't know good copy if it slapped them in the face only give a tenth of a tin shit about the first two.)\n\nUltimately, I just have no idea where to go. I'm sad, scared and angry. \n\nThankfully, content management is still a somewhat viable career field, I guess. Even in the most automated workplace settings, they still need humans to babysit the robots; to keep them running. There are jobs out there, and I'm going to aggressively pursue them...largely because I have no choice. I'm also getting a tidy severance package — one that will just about wipe out my credit card debt, which is a VERY slim silver lining. I can likely also apply for unemployment. So there's that. \n\nBut overall, I'm just crushed. Broken. Beaten down by capitalism. Torn up by the constant pursuit of profit over people, the understanding that this is the most dismal job market in years, and the ever-present knowledge that no matter how good you are at your career, at any given time, some wonk with a red budget pen can just click a spreadsheet and drop a virtual dirty bomb into your entire life. Then go on with their day like it's nothing. Because it is nothing. To THEM, at least.\n\nIf you've read this far, I appreciate you. But I also need help, which is something that I am characteristically LOATH to ask for, even under the most dire of circumstances. Please, I beg of you: if you know of anyone who is hiring for a Content Manager, Creative Director, Social Media Manager, Marketing Manager, or (I'll take a step down if I have to) Sr. Copywriter, PLEASE refer them to me. I know it's a tall order. I know I'm likely boned. And I know we're ALL pretty screwed lately, since creative jobs are dying out fast thanks to the \"aY-EyE rEvOLuTiOn\", but — this is all I know. It's all I'm good at. And I can do it in my sleep. Plus, I can't really \"pivot\" at 50, y'know...? \n\nThank you for reading. And may we ultimately triumph over the goddamned clankers. ",

      "title": "Who is WordPress now for?",
      "selftext": "First of all, I'd like to set some context. I run two companies in the UK which use WordPress extensively. The first one (now in its 12th year) is a small digital agency, offering consultancy, training and website development to our (niche) client base. Projects are reasonably big, always bespoke (ie no off the shelf themes, all done from ground up, project managed, \"big picture\" thinking around strategy, branding, workshops, etc - typical project 6-9 month duration). The second one is a more productised solution for our niche, offering much lower cost WordPress based sites with our own \"special sauce\" components and functionality, typically (but not always) using GeneratePress and WordPress multisite to deliver. \n\nI have been involved in WordPress development for 10+ years and have thus been watching the development of Gutenberg since the outset. \n\nOur original MO was (like most agencies / individuals I know) to make custom ACF Flexible Content fields. All good - lots of flexibility, but (and I'll come back to this in a moment), lots of **control** \\- you could design row by row, test row by row, make sure that everything worked ok across devices - all good. Also lots of options to add new stuff as the client asked for it - although sometimes a bit clunky to have to delve right into what is essentially your own page builder - reasonably ok to support and design / develop for. \n\nWith Gutenberg we (again, like many agencies) held off for a bit - the initial Gutenberg was pretty terrible but after a couple of years it had matured enough to be practical for large and reasonably complex sites. With it came some pretty major concerns that I have talked through with fellow agency owners - and in fact got looped in to Matt Mullenweg at one point - but basically these concerns (as I say, not just me but for pretty much everyone I've spoken to) revolve around issues of **freedom and design control** and, correspondingly, **audience**. Gutenberg (certainly at first - it's a *bit* better now but not 100% solid) gives unprecedented levels of control to your site editors. Even at its most locked down - as in, turning off pretty much all blocks, the \"block locking\" options available - it's still relatively easy to - frankly - really badly balls up a page. All it takes is a copy-paste from one of the hundreds of (sometimes - *really* bad) block / block pattern sites, or even from another page on the same site - and your whole page falls apart - it's literally Frankendesign, a hotch-potch with no visual purpose at all. \n\nAlthough the editing experience is much more fluid now (images are a dream compared to previous iterations, copy-paste is a joy when populating a big site, etc etc), these layout issues are considerable. With full \"lock-down\" they can be bearable - but still - I don't think anyone would argue that what you want your clients to have is **full control** over their site. They're not designers, they're not tech people - they're (in my 20+ year experience anyway!) people who want to *edit their content* which is, after all what a **content management system** is actually about - managing content... You don't want them to have access to change the site fonts or colours, in the same way building in controls to move the logo from the left side to right is almost always a waste of time because it is extremely rare that anyone wants to do that...\n\nAnd then... here comes FSE. \n\nNow - I've tried really hard to understand who this is pitched at. Is it the \"Wix / Squarespace\" market - in other words, lowest possible denominator - ie \"business owners\" who now don't need to go and employ a designer or developer - guys with agencies or running single-person WP houses seem remarkably redundant in this world, and although it is arguably cheaper for the end user - it isn't necessarily easier. Like - in this world, surely you'd just recommend [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com) which has not only all these tools but also does the irritating hosting / maintenance / etc side of things...?\n\nOr - is it that us agency / design &amp; dev individuals are literally now supposed to design in the browser, lock down everything then save out using the *Create Block Theme* plugin?\n\nDoes the core development team *really* think that end-users understand concepts around styling a page, implications around layout when thinking about block styles, padding, margins, grids? Let alone theme.json or the wider, more complex picture stuff like global styles vs local ones? The clients I work with want to make things bold and maybe add a link and an image - they have zero concept (and why would they...) of what a \"cascading style sheet\" even is, let alone how to use one.\n\nI would really appreciate anyone's thoughts on this. I just don't understand, strategically, where and why WordPress is heading in this direction. What worries me most is that what seems to be the core motivation: **give everyone more control** is actually a dangerous simplification of reality. I don't want to think that the core team is ploughing ahead making things just because they can rather than because they should - but, honestly, I don't see much evidence that there is deeper thinking going on.\n\nWould love - genuinely - to be proved wrong, and would love to understand everyone else's thoughts on this. Apologies for the insanely long post, too ;-)",

      "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nLooking for some advice here on what others are doing.\n\nI've previously built extensively with ACF, using flexible content modules to create custom themes that feature various page templates. These pages templates have various content modules available for the client to edit, all with there own custom fields etc.\n\nWe can then build this out with our preferred file structure in the theme. Using webpack to build and compile all assets into a neat little theme for the client.\n\nThe client has the control they need (through ACF fields) and we keep the design in check through the custom theme.\n\nNow I've tried my best to move to the block editor, but I've always felt I've done this half-heartedly.\n\nACF blocks have been great so far. A perfect match of old-school PHP and the new block editor. We can still use Webpack to crawl through all our custom blocks and build the final asset files required. But I feel like going all in in custom blocks might be the way to go.\n\nMy main issue though is with the block editor itself. We've gone from a tightly managed theme/website for the client, to something they have way to much freedom over.\n\nI know you can disable core blocks, remove settings from core block where possible. But this seems so counter intuitive. The client now has so many customisable options per block, on every page/post of the website, and can mess with things. Fast forward months down the line, and new content etc has moved away from the tight brand guidelines we had in the past.\n\nOn-top of this, customising the block editor feels so \"hacky\". Overriding default block styles via CSS (if they can't be set via theme.json), dealing with the HTML outputted by core blocks and working within these constraints. It feels way less \"custom\" to me and more like I'm trying to force a horrible page builder website to look the way I want it to.\n\nMaybe this is a learning curve with modern WP that I'm still on, but each time I try to push into \"full\" modern WP, it doesn't feel right.",

I don't have FTP or SSH access to anything. I don't have a local dev environment. I'm having to use a plugin in the WP admin to view and edit the filesystem and I can't see or change file permissions. I can't access the server logs and WP debug log is only working half the time. I cannot install or modify anything about the server (wanted to install phpdotenv but one of the guys on the internal IT team was able to setup some Azure env vars for me, so that's alright).\n\nThey asked me to setup a vanilla HTML form to post to an external API that I have no visibility on and the team managing the API is overseas and takes hours to respond. As far as I can tell from the API schema they gave me, I've got my post request going through correctly and should be getting an integer back (I assume 1 for success, 0 for error?) but the API is returning 200 along with an internal HTML page for the platform the overseas team built the API on. I have no idea if my request is going through correctly and it's their API that's broken or if the schema and endpoint they gave me is incorrect or what. Doing a pretty standard curl post request off an AJAX call from the front end. I've tested my code every which way I can think of and without hearing anything different from API team, I believe my stuff is fine. Just spinning my wheels knowing that this whole task needs to be done ASAP.\n\nNo one on any of the internal or overseas IT teams knows WP and overseas team doesn't know PHP at all. Overseas team handling the API refused to even give me the API details at first and then completely changed the entire API from REST to GraphQL last second. I have a feeling their stuff is just a pile of jank. I've never used GraphQL before but as far as I can see I'm setting up my request right.\n\nI'm just nervous because I wanted to make a good impression but the setup I'm working with is making that a slim chance. I don't want to come off as a shitty craftsman blaming the tools but this is the most chaotic and wonky setup I've ever worked with.\n\nHave you had to work with a big corporate outfit that had dumpster fire dev setups with no standardization, organization, or proper communication?

      "selftext": "I was chatting with a friend today who was all hyped about turning 4K into 200K or even 2M. And I'm like, \"how about focusing on making your first sale first?\" (He is starting a small online business)\r  \n\r  \n\\- I've started three businesses; the first two didn't work out.\r  \n\\- Took one business from zero to 100K in three years. Yep, years, not months.\r  \n\r  \nI'm not a millionaire or an MBA grad. I've just worked my butt off to get better at what I do.\r  \n\r  \nI’ve spent a lot of time with other entrepreneurs and I wanted to say a few things that I are usually never shared about entrepreneurship:\r  \n\r  \n**First sale over millions:** the first time I made a sale, I cried. I had put in so much work, and finally, someone believed in my product enough to buy it. It's a moment that makes all the sleepless nights worth it. Don't chase millions; focus on that first sale. It's a game-changer.\r  \n\r  \n**The hustle can be brutal**: You think you're gonna work a few hours a week and become a millionaire? it doesn't work like that. I've had weeks where I barely made enough to cover my bills, despite working 100-hour weeks. It's a grind, but if you stick with it, the payoff can be huge. Just don't expect it to happen overnight.\r  \n\r  \n**Don't be a copycat**: I spent way too much time trying to emulate other successful entrepreneurs. Big mistake. The moment I embraced my unique style and approach, things started to click. You've got to be you because nobody else can. Also, entrepreneurs usually only tell the good things about their journey (1% of it), so you always feel you are a failure in comparison. \r  \n\r  \n**The emotional toll:** running a business can mess with your head. I've had relationships fall apart and missed countless social events because I was tied to my work. It's a sacrifice, but one I knew I had to make. Still, it's essential to find a balance; otherwise, you'll burn out.\r  \n\r  \n**Learning vs. Doing**: I used to hoard courses and books thinking they'd make me successful. But knowledge is useless without action. These days, I focus more on implementing what I learn, rather than just consuming information.\r  \n\r  \n**Lonely journey**: Most of my friends with 9-5 jobs just don't get the stress and responsibility that come with running a business. It can be isolating, but it's crucial to surround yourself with people who understand your journey and can offer genuine advice.\r  \n\r  \n**Get help, seriously**: The moment you can afford it, delegate. I used to hate admin tasks, so hiring a VA was a game-changer for me. It freed me up to focus on what I'm good at.\r  \n\r  \n**The youtube trap**: It's easy to get sucked into the success stories and think that's the norm. But those guys went through a lot of failures to get where they are. Your journey is your own; don't compare it to a highlight reel.\r  \n\r  \n**The long game**: If you can pay your bills this month, you're doing alright. If you can pay them next month too, you're killing it. The real wins in business come from sustained effort over time, not overnight success.\r  \n\r  \n**You're a rare breed**: If you've started a business, you're already ahead of the game. You're one of the brave souls willing to take a risk and chase a dream. Never forget how awesome that makes you.\r  \n\r  \nStarting a business makes you a special kind of crazy, in a good way. You're chasing your dreams, and that's something to be proud of. Surround yourself with people who get it and will keep it real with you. And more importantly, surround yourself with people that will tell you the truth.",

Not even a complaint really, just asking if anyone else was experiencing similar issues with their integration. A competitor saw it within hours and jumped into their DMs with a solution. By the time I found out about the post (through a casual mention in a meeting), they had already started migrating to the competitor.\n\nThe worst part is the issue they posted about was something we could have fixed in 15 minutes. It was a common configuration problem we'd solved for other clients dozens of times.\n\nI got cocky. Thought I had a great relationship with this client and they'd always come to us directly with issues. Learned the hard way that customers don't always complain to your face - they ask their peers first.\n\nNow I'm religiously checking Reddit, industry forums, and review sites daily. Probably overcorrecting, but losing your biggest client has a way of changing your habits.\n\nAnyone else learn an expensive lesson the hard way? I'd rather learn from others than to run into another seemingly simple but expensive oversight again.\n\nEdit: For those asking - yes, I tried to fix things.

      "title": "Closing my business after 18 years",
      "selftext": "This is long, and to some degree this post is a way for me to help make sense and reflect on my decision to close my business after 18 years.  We fabricated and installed stone, quartz and solid surface countertops and decorative surfaces for mostly commercial construction projects and some residential work.  We have done work at the White House, Camp David, Various Senate and Congressional office, the cafeteria at the Supreme Court, the capital visitors center.  Many small projects at various government agencies including CIA, NSA, and at the pentagon.  There were hundreds of popular restaurants in the D.C. area.  Hundreds of McDonalds restaurants throughout PA, MD and Virginia.  Schools, churches, apartment complexes and condos.  Thousands of small office spaces throughout the area.   To date we have done over 32,000 jobs over 18 years.  I drive throughout the city and memories of many many projects come to mind.   I thought I did everything right.  \n\nWe tried to run a fair and safe operation for my staff.  We paid my employees a competitive wage, so that they would stay.  We paid our vendors on time so that they would help me out when I had a special request.   I reminded my staff that my boss was our customers and that my boss could fire us at any time.   We worked hard to perform our craft at a high level, while serving a wide range of customers from low budget developers to the most demanding architects and designers. \n\nWe survived multiple economic down turns.  We had no debt, and we were profitable 17 of the 18 years.  Some were profitable enough to add new equipment and justify controlled expansion and new investment.   I had plans of working another 5-7 years while taking on new employee partners that would eventually buy me out.  But, that’s not going to happen.  \n\nIt might be tempting to pin the challenges on the economy, but that would be an oversimplification. We made a major miscalculation in the real estate market beginning around 2020 and that mistake lead to me closing today.  \n\nThe primary issue stems from a significant imbalance in the commercial real estate market. Shifts in demographics due to COVID altered demand, squeezing the availability of light industrial manufacturing spaces in central Maryland. This drove up rental rates far beyond standard inflation. Moreover, a few untimely events that were particular to our scenario played a role. I believed I had prepared sufficiently, but the eventual outcome was beyond my prediction.\n\nIn 2018, my building’s landlord suffered a stroke. After his recovery, he decided against tying up the majority of his wealth in real estate. We’d been his tenant for roughly 12 years. Wanting liquidity, he decided to sell the building, as his family was neither interested nor capable of managing such properties.\n\nSurprisingly, the building was sold almost immediately. The new landlord assured us of no immediate changes. However, the situation took a turn when COVID hit in March 2020. Upon lease renewal, our rate was hiked by 50%. After some negotiation, we settled for a one-year extension. As 2021 unfolded, the business landscape remained unpredictable. The rental market seemed stable, but both we and our landlord felt the uncertainties. Upon another lease negotiation, our rate was increased by an additional 15%. The relocation of our business, along with necessary upgrades, would be extremely expensive, which made staying put for another year more convenient.\n\nOur property search in 2022 began with optimism. After exploring several properties, we were met with an unforeseen hurdle. Merritt, the largest commercial property owner in the region, was hesitant to lease to us, severely limiting our options.\n\nAs we searched, rental rates had surged. Warehouses were going for as much as $20/sf. Agents explained that major corporations, driven by “the Amazon effect”, had been securing warehouse spaces to be closer to Amazon distribution centers.\n\nIn May, we identified a promising location in nearby. The negotiations were progressing until unexpected costs were introduced, far exceeding our initial agreement. Feeling taken advantage of, we walked away.\n\nIn August, a potential opportunity near Balttimore surfaced through our lawyer. Everything seemed perfect, but unforeseen emotional factors from the owner and challenges surrounding the lease start date led to another dead-end.\n\nThen, the economy took a turn for the worse. Our sales and work booking rates dropped significantly. With a dim outlook for the future.  additionally Election years in the DC market are always slower for commercial construction, as the various businesses that support (or leech from) the government sit on the sidelines waiting to decide how to invest in their local offices.  We questioned the wisdom of investing heavily in a rushed relocation, and a long-term lease.\n\nOn September 6th, after nights of pondering, I decided not to proceed. My partners and I concluded it was wiser to walk away with our current assets, providing capital for potential new ventures or adding to my retirement fund.\n\nThe subsequent days were heart-wrenching. I had to relay the sad news to my dedicated staff, some of whom had been with me for nearly two decades. Despite the challenges, I worked tirelessly to ensure their well-being and future employment.\n\nI’ve now started informing my long-term customers, who were equally shocked by our closure.  The first four customers I informed all offered me a job.  I was honored, but graciously declined.  It was comforting to know that they cared.  \n\nThis has been the most challenging task of my life, barring the eulogy I delivered for my late brother. \n\nThe upcoming tasks are daunting: winding down the business, completing existing jobs, selling our assets, and vacating the property by December 29th.\n\nAs I type this, I don’t yet know what my future holds.  I do know that for the first time since my youth, when I delivered newspapers I’ll be unemployed.\n\n.",

The mobile beer trailer plus being a high ticket remote closer has changed my life I don't have to work a 9-5 and I get to work from home and make my own schedule. Now I'm on a mission to save up to open up something small. I want to try and make my own beer and open up a micro-brewery in the next 2 years.",

They waited until the last moment.\n\n• Stripe claimed they would refund money to customers within five days. My client confirmed they received nothing. Stripe kept the funds.\n\n• My client provided a signed statement confirming the payment was legitimate, the work was delivered, and no dispute will ever be filed. Stripe ignored it.\n\n• All communication from Stripe is a copy-paste response: “high risk.” No explanation, no evidence, no path to resolution.\n\nThe numbers:\n\nDisputed amount: $50\nAmount Stripe is keeping: $7,946\nRatio: 160 times the disputed amount\nThe dispute is from a different customer and is already resolved.\n\nWhat I’ve done:\n\n• Complaint filed with Stripe.

The business is a custom furniture shop, we design and build custom furniture for clients and designers around the area. The first year was great, we did 30% more in sales than the previous owner ever did in 7 years of business. Designed and created some insanely cool furniture. I had to purchase bigger and more efficient equipment to keep up with our demand, this meant taking out a loan of $50,000 in July of 2022. Sales picked up even more, and I ended up hiring 2 more guys (now 4 total). All was going fine up until about June of 2023, sales dropped off. I still had a strong feeling that we had something good going so I decided to double down and take out another $30,000 loan and invest in marketing and a little more equipment. This is where I feel I messed up. Took the loan, and basically used it to pay my guys while the company was \"slowly\" drowning. \n\nAs of 2 weeks ago, I had to let 2 guys go. As of next week I will have to let the last 2 guys go. I'm out of money. Feel like complete shit. Feel paralyzed mentally and am unable to think of a single move to make to get out of this hole.

If you’re new, please read this, these are common red flags I’ve noticed (and others have pointed out too).\n\n🚩 **Red Flags to Watch Out For**\n\n**Vague + overpromising posts**\n\nExample: “Data entry, earn $40–$120/day.” No details, just high pay for easy work. That’s a red flag.\n\n**Suspiciously new accounts**\n\nNot all new accounts are scams, but often these posts come from users with:\n- Only 1 post (usually vague)\n- No comment history\n- Recently created accounts\n\n**Weird contact info, like WhatsApp/TG**\n\nIf the number’s name doesn’t match their WA/TG username, or the country code looks unusual, be cautious. Many scammers pretend to be “employers” but are actually just recruiters collecting data.\n\n**Overly generic or copy-paste job posts**\n\nSome posts look like they were auto-generated and not even reviewed. AI-assisted posts aren’t bad by themselves, but scammers and time-wasters often put out vague, incomplete, or overpromising listings that don’t explain the actual job.\n\n👉 If you clarify with them and their reply is still vague or evasive, trust your gut and move on. Real clients usually know (or can explain) what they want.\n\n**Fake “test tasks” that are actually the real job**\n\nSome posts ask you to complete a “sample” before paying, like rewriting part of a PDF, doing lead searches, or transcribing a few pages. Be careful: if 10 people each submit a “sample,” the scammer now has 100 leads/pages done for free and will ghost everyone.\n\n👉 Legitimate clients might ask for small samples, but it should never be full or substantial work. A good rule: if the sample looks like billable work, don’t do it without a contract or partial payment first.\n\n**Ghosting or “collecting applicants”**\n\nSome posts are just made to farm responses. They’ll vanish, never reply, or ask for “samples” before confirming anything. Don’t waste time if they can’t be clear up front.\n\nIf you’re unsure, **ask in the sub before applying**. Experienced freelancers here can help you double-check.\n\nHope this helps you save time and protect you. If something feels “off,” it usually is. Don’t be afraid to walk away. There will always be better, safer opportunities.",

      "title": "6 things that will make your life easier as a freelance web dev",
      "selftext": "I'm gonna make this as quick as possible. I'm actually doing a long post like this for another place, but I'll publish the shorter, no-bullshit version here. Excuse my English, but boy, do I wish I'd read something like this 5 years ago. I'm sure most never had these problems, but I did. It doesn't matter how good of a developer or designer you are. Being a freelancer with no business skills (or business logic) is a recipe for disaster.\n\n# Intro:\n\nI've been doing websites for clients for the past 5 years. Three of those years were a worthless time of my life I'll never get back. I worked 12 hours a day including weekends and holidays, and I had nothing to show for it except a big portfolio of projects.\n\nIf I had to do everything again from scratch, it would take me a year or less and I wouldn't lose 3+ years down the toilet.\n\nI know this is probably basic stuff to most people. But it wasn't basic to me because I was a dumb business owner.\n\n# 1. Don’t Be Cheap\n\nBeing cheap is a perfect scenario to become overworked while staying poor. Cheap clients, in my experience, are the worst. They only look for the cheapest option and always expect too much. None of them want to admit or accept that you can’t perform miracles for cheap rates and below every possible hourly rate that keeps you fed and financially stable.\n\nCheap clients bring zero value in the long run. Sure, some money is better than no money if you’re struggling, but let me say this again: cheap clients are worthless.\n\nThe best flow of clients you can get is through recommendations. For cheap clients, you'll only ever be the “I know a dude who’s cheap.” The leads they bring will always be useless because they will also go for the cheapest option out there. If you charge more, you’ll be the “I know a guy who does a great job.” That’s a big difference in the quality of leeds. Whenever I get a lead from one of my past cheap clients, they get a heart attack when I'm telling them my price although I'm still cheap.\n\nThe only reason for you to be cheap is if you are just starting out and need to build your portfolio, or if you are doing a project for family and friends. But that’s about it. If your work is bad and you can only get cheap clients because of that, you’re doomed to stay stressed out while making zero career progress.\n\nIt’s not just having a food on the table. More money means more money to invest, improve, and get your business and work to the next level. If you’re only working to pay your bills, you can’t improve. You can’t buy the Shutterstock/AI/fancy plugin subscriptions, you can’t buy software that would make your life easier, you can’t buy a new PC, and you’re stuck with outdated equipment.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. You can’t charge $50k for a landing page with 3 sections either. But respect your hourly rate that keeps you fed and be real with yourself when calculating how many hours a project will take.\n\n# How to Set Your Hourly Rate:\n\nBe honest with yourself. You can’t grind 12 hours a day. There are only 5 hours of intense work you can do in a day in the long run. Sure I was busting my balls for 12 hours a day at the start, but believe me when I say that it took the toll on me. The rest of the time is talking to dead leads, dealing with bureaucracy, keeping your things in order, following the important news, etc. So effective work is 5 hours a day. Take into account vacations, sick leave, and everything else, and you’ll most likely realize what your hourly rate needs to be.\n\n# 2. Offer Maintenance\n\nThe business of building websites is a mess. If you live from project to project, you are in a loop of constantly looking for new leads, and you need to finish X projects per month to stay afloat. Shit happens, and there will be times when you don’t have new leads for a month or more.\n\nTo prevent this, you need to upsell maintenance packages. I met a guy who lives comfortably as a web designer/dev. Half of his income comes from maintenance packages alone.\n\nWe all know that shit happens. Things go south, and the last thing you want is for it to be your problem to solve for free.\n\nHere’s an example: You delivered a project to a client 2 years ago and they have no maintenance package. They paid you a single invoice and that's it. Suddenly, they call you, say that the website is broken, and that it’s your job to fix it for free because they paid for a functional website 2 years ago and they expect it to be functional for the next 20 years.\n\nWhen you analyze the situation, you find out that their entire low-budget server got hacked, their data got erased, and the only thing you can do is a full rebuild and charge the client again the full price. Maybe you offer a 50% discount, but this will destroy your hourly rate and set you back to the level of a student who just learned to install WP two days ago. No client would be happy with this proposal, and they’ll blame you for their issues. They will probably move to another web dev, write you a bad review on Google My Business and they're gonna keep telling their own (false) version of the story of their experience with you whenever they talk with someone about web design.\n\nMaintenance prevents all of this.\n\n* Regular backups keep the data safe when things go wrong. MainWP/Vivid PRO combo is great for this.\n* Regular system updates (plugins if you’re using WP) prevent vulnerabilities (follow Wordfence news, prioritize updating whatever is vulnerable through MainWP).\n* Testing the site after each update is a must to see if something went wrong during the update process. If something becomes incompatible, it's your job to fix the code and solve the issues. It’s part of the maintenance.\n* Priority support. When you're overloaded with work, it's gonna be easier (and neccessary) to offer priority support for those who pay maintenance packages.\n\nMy maintenance packages also include ability for the client to talk with me through Whatsapp/Viber, call me on weekends (only a few those with big enough maintenance packages), and so on. Some clients appreciate support like this and they easily see the value in it.\n\nDepending on the functionalities of the website, you can adjust your rates for maintenance packages for each client. A small static website doesn’t need many updates or maintenance. Update the system twice a year, do one backup per year, and that’s it. The price can easily be equivalent to 4 hours of your time because maintenance in this case won’t take more than that. If you have 10 of those small website maintenance packages, you’ve got a week of your time covered.\n\nA big store that has 100+ orders per day needs backups done daily. Because every downtime translates to a big loss of revenue, you of course need to do updates on a test environment first. These things require time, so charge accordingly. For these kinds of projects, you can easily charge 40 hours of your time per year. If you have 8 of those clients, you’ve got 2 months covered. That’s 2 months less searching for new clients next year.\n\nNow imagine having a mix of maintenance packages. 10 clients on the highest package, 40 on the smallest packages, and 30 somewhere in between (dynamic sites with weekly backups, monthly updates). This easily covers almost half of your time. Call it a “maintenance Wednesday” and life becomes easier.\n\nThis was all just technical maintenance. If your clients want you to write blog posts, run the social media account, or whatever, this is something custom you can offer as well.\n\nBut for the love of god, charge your maintenance packages for a year upfront. The worst thing in the world is to hunt clients each month because they forgot or are unwilling to pay.\n\n# 3. Demand Payment Upfront\n\nDemanding payment upfront is an industry standard. Not only does it protect you from not being paid at all, but it also keeps the client in check. Because let’s be real. Here are some of the quite popular excuses you’re surely gonna hear in the middle of some projects when you’ve already spent tens of hours on them:\n\n* \"Sorry, but we decided that we don’t need a website anymore (so we won’t pay you).\"\n* \"We just found out that our boss has a cousin who does websites as well, so we're gonna hand the project over to him (so we won’t pay you).\"\n* \"We lost funding we needed for the project, so we are canceling it immediately (so we won’t pay you).\"\n\nThis happens more often than you think. With partial payment upfront, you are safe from not being paid at all. But that’s not all.\n\nThe other thing is that 50% upfront keeps the client motivated to finish the project. There are tons of clients who become slow to respond to your questions and requests in the middle of the project. A project that would take 1 week becomes a 3+ month journey, and your hourly rate goes down the toilet.\n\nWhen clients pay 50% upfront, they are more motivated to finish the project sooner because it’s not just your time on the line anymore, but their money as well. “We paid 50%, let’s make sure they deliver” thoughts come into effect, and the client will be more responsive and you’ll be able to finish the project sooner.\n\n# 4. Charge for Everything\n\nI was dumb for not doing this in the first few years. But you need to charge for everything. Every time you work on something for a client, your time needs to be paid. You are a business and you can’t pay your bills with thank yous.\n\nMany clients never believe that the project is ever finished and expect you to work on upgrades and minor fixes indefinitely for free. If you don’t enforce being paid for your time once the project is finished, nothing prevents them from asking you to work for them free of charge over and over again.\n\nIf you’re like me and have 40 clients calling and emailing you each month to do things you never agreed to, you need to stop it right now and charge for everything. Clients will either stop bugging you (you’ll profit time), or they’ll start paying and you’ll profit money.\n\nWhen I started enforcing being paid for everything extra, a client actually told me, “Finally, you should have been charging us for months already.”\n\nI'm not saying you need to charge every 30-second work as well. But always do the calculation of what would happen if all of the 100 of your clients needed the same thing in a month. Would you still be profitable or would you work for 100 hours for free?\n\n# 5. Don’t Deliver Unless You’re Paid\n\nEven though you demand 50% upfront, there are still clients out there who would love to scam you for the other 50%. To protect yourself from this, don’t deliver until you’re paid in full.\n\nAn example of this kind of situation would be when clients think your website will bring them millions of revenue in a heartbeat. Maybe they don’t even have the money to pay you in the first place but expect to get the needed revenue after you deliver. This is not how this works, so you have to avoid getting scammed.\n\nLock the website up (so they can’t run ads on it) until it’s paid. Block it from Google and search engines, and don’t move it from your test environment to their server. Once the bill is paid, finish it up.\n\n# 6. Use Proposals and Contracts\n\nBefore you even lift a finger for a client’s project, you need to have a contract in place. Otherwise, you can end up in an endless loop of demands that will destroy your hourly rate.\n\nImagine this: You get a call from a prospect who wants a website. Their demands are “I just want a very simple website, nothing extraordinary.” It’s a simple project with a few contact forms, some static content, a sticky header, and that’s it. You set up a price you believe is right for 20 hours of your time and you can immediately start working on the project, expecting it will all be done in a few days.\n\nBut then during the process, the client starts demanding more. Lots of custom solutions, a booking system, Stripe integration, whatever. And if you don’t agree that that’s your job for the agreed price, you have nothing to back it up. The client doesn’t remember the small talk over the phone when they said they want a simple website. If you don’t want to do the extra work, the client can walk away and you’ve lost days of your time. If you grind it out, the project doesn’t take 20 hours to be finished, but 60. Your hourly rate decreases by 66% and you basically got screwed over.\n\nHere’s how my proposal system works:\n\nI talk with the prospect extensively to see what they want, what they need, and I ask them over 10 questions.\n\nOnce they reply, I write EVERYTHING I’m offering for their project.\n\nMy contract for a website design usually includes:\n\n* Unique design based on client’s wishes and my recommendations\n* List of tools/software I’m going to use\n* Expected deadline (which starts only when the client sends me every piece of needed material and agrees on the design draft)\n* Domain and hosting details – who pays them and what’s the renewal cost\n* Number of unique pages (Homepage, About us, Contact, Team, Service)\n* Wireframe of their website\n* Functionality (contact forms, booking form, store, payment processors integrations, Google Maps integration…)\n* Number of articles/products I’m willing to publish on their site myself\n* Blog/news functionality\n* Video tutorial on how to publish and edit the news section\n* GA and GWT integration\n* Basic onsite SEO optimization\n* How much time after the project delivery I’m willing to work on small edits and fixes\n* What kind of maintenance comes with my offer (1 year upfront)\n* Etc.\n\nOnce my proposal is finished, I send it over to the prospect. I ask them to confirm my offer via email. This way I have it all written down and the client knows exactly what they agreed to. This way I have all the proof I need in case the client starts demanding more in the process.\n\nIt’s not a problem to do extra work for any client. But when it’s not something that was agreed to and it’s gonna take me hours, they need to pay extra.",

You can read it for free [on my GitHub](https://github.com/wiktorjarosz/deep-dives) or as a series of articles [on my blog](https://wiktorjarosz.com/wordpress/introduction/).\n\n  \nHi,\n\nI've been creating WordPress websites for around 2 years now, but I never really understood how WordPress worked. I decided to change that a few months ago and really learn it. You can imagine how disappointed I was when I realized that most resources fall into one of three categories:\n\n* Tutorials aimed at beginners.\n* Technical documentation with no clear opinionated structure and flow for learning.\n* Marketing BS.\n\nWhen I try to learn something deeply, I find tutorials and mindless practice rather unproductive. Instead, I always see the biggest benefits when I go down the rabbit hole. I don't just want to know how something works or what function to use. I want to know why it works. I want to know how it ties to other parts of the system. I keep asking more and more questions until I don't have any more to ask. This is why I wrote this e-book.\n\nAs the title suggests, \"WordPress Deep Dive\" goes deep into all important parts of WordPress. It is not a tutorial, and you will probably not be able to get a website up and running after reading it. It's a 287-page system architecture case study, analyzing one of the largest web development frameworks in the world. Its goal is not to teach you how to write good WordPress code. It's to make you understand the very foundation your code runs on.\n\nSome of the most important topics covered include:\n\n* The request lifecycle\n* Hooks\n* The template hierarchy\n* Custom post types\n* Custom fields\n* Classic and Block editors\n* Blocks and block development\n* Themes\n* Plugins\n* Translations\n* Security (including validation, escaping, sanitization, nonces, SQL injections, XML-RPC, and more)\n* REST API\n\nAnd these are only 12 out of 32 top-level chapters. Some other important and/or niche chapters include taxonomies, shortcodes, post revisions, user accounts, AJAX, HTTP API, Rewrite API, Filesystem API, WP-Cron, caching, Multisite, WP-CLI, and more.\n\nAs I already implied, I started this project as a way to learn WordPress myself. Over time, it has evolved into what I think is a decent starting point for anyone who wants to become an expert WordPress developer. I don't consider myself to be one yet, but spending over 300 hours on this document has certainly brought me much closer to achieving this goal. I hope the e-book does the same for at least one other person.\n\nPDF: [https://github.com/wiktorjarosz/deep-dives](https://github.com/wiktorjarosz/deep-dives)  \nWeb-based version: [https://wiktorjarosz.com/wordpress/introduction/](https://wiktorjarosz.com/wordpress/introduction/)\n\nCheers,  \nWiktor\n\nPS: I'll be grateful for any feedback you guys have - both positive and negative.",

      "selftext": "**EDIT 2**: Hi all, I've asked the mods to lock this post (so please don't go after them). I think it's done its job as far as sharing what I needed to share with the community, and I personally don't want to spend more time replying to everyone (especially the trolls here). If there are any other updates, I'll post them as an edit here. Hang in there.\n\n---\n\nA lot of people here seem to think that clients aren't aware of what's going on and therefore the impact will be minimal on developers. On a recent thread, the vast majority of commenters shrugged off the controversy as irrelevant to their day-to-day. And while that may be true for teeny tiny single-owner websites, some of us deal directly with large companies or white label through agencies, and let me tell you: their CMOs are well aware of what's happening.\n\nBackground: I'm a one-man outfit, who partners with a local visual designer to do the design work, or works white label to do the entire build for agencies.\n\n* I had a contract *signed and ready to go* for 2025, where the budget for dev was $40k, and now they've backed out to reconsider the CMS as a whole, as a result of Mullenweg's petty war with WPE.\n* I had another contract that just got signed with WPE (right before our Dictator for Life attacked WPE at WordCamp), the website for which I'm actively building right now. I'm also WPE affiliate. The client would have backed out of hosting if not for the extensive legal review they had to go through to set up the hosting in the first place, and they've only decided to stay on WPE for the short term. Potential impact on me is thousands of dollars in referral fees.\n* I have had three other key clients (large % of total revenue) I manage whose sites I built reach out to me for reassurance since WordCamp to ask if the platform is stable going forward. All of them are CTOs or CMOs. All I could say is that with honesty is *no one knows what the future holds*. I can't even reassure them on *the platform's stability*. All because of one terroristic founder who's bent on destroying what shred of good faith is left in his creation. I won't blame them for switching platforms on the next design refresh because of this. But that's a loss of *huge* potential revenue for me as a single-owner freelancer.\n\nSo yes, we *are* suffering. I'm considering picking up at least 3 other popular CMS's as offerings over my winter break to contend with this. This is huge and I'm glad the mods opened discussion so we can track of this on a post-by-post basis. This should be front page until WordPress is a stable platform again!\n\n**EDIT 1**: If you're here to troll, attack my credibility as a developer, or call my whole ordeal fake, I've called out the handful of you already in these threads, and the majority of you who aren't capable of having good faith discussions I've blocked. And let me remind you that block evasion is characterized on Reddit as harassment that should be reported. The vast majority of the community here, however, I've found is honest and wants to talk through this controversy that is facing us and, as I've learned in this thread, actively hurting *a lot* of us freelancers right now. Thank you for that honest discussion. To the rest of you: why don't you get back to work rather than wasting your breath victim blaming?",

Some people write code to directly put into open source software - while I write code in my day job, get paid, then use that money to buy domains from squatters to give it to open source and charities.\n\n20 years ago, I gave the domain [Wordpress.com](http://Wordpress.com) to Matt Mullenweg.  Then he sued me and I lost everything. (Clarification: I did transfer the domain [WordPress.com](http://WordPress.com) to Matt for Free, but it was not part of OpenDomain.  The project was new and I did not have everything setup at the time.)\n\nWhen Matt sued me, I had severe emotional distress.  I lost my my job. My life savings. My house. I almost lost my family and my life.   I hated Matt more than I thought possible   I went to therapy for years. My therapist was absolutely amazing.  She helped me get past the hate and I learned some important wisdom:\n\n* She asked me if I wanted to get lawyers to try to take the domain back.  I answered that I did not - mostly because I did now want the stress of another lawsuit, but also because I still wanted to support WordPress and Matt was the person.  Kind of like I found his wallet, and I was just returning it to him.\n* I sometimes could not sleep from the hate I felt.  I thought about bad things every day.  What helped me get past the hate was when my therapist asked me if Matt thought about me.  When I realized that Matt did not care about me or my family, that he probably did not even know who I was, then I realized that the hate was a poison that only hurt me.\n* Here is the biggest kicker:   Matt may not be evil in his own mind.  He may sued me out was just something he was doing to as part of business.  Or one of his investors asked him to file the lawsuit.\n\nMy goal for writing this post to hope that WordPress community does not get hurt. I am sure that Matt has made some mistakes. But maybe he was just protecting Wordpress and just over-reacted? Also think about the companies against Matt - what have they contributed to Wordpress?  What can they gain by vilifying Matt? Maybe someone wants him out so they can gain control?\n\nPlease note that I am I am not justifying anything.  I do not know what really is going on.  But HATE is the path to the dark side.\n\nMy goal for OpenDomain is to promote open source, and in that Matt has done an amazing job.\n\nWordPress is fantastic software.

What you frame as a noble fight for security reeks of arrogance and a disturbing overreach of power.\n\nThe move to wrest control of ACF from WP Engine and strip away its commercial elements not only disrupts ongoing development but sends a clear message: if a company doesn’t conform to your vision, you’re willing to take drastic measures to force them out. The WordPress community thrives on openness, cooperation, and trust—values that your hostile maneuver has trampled on. Instead of engaging in constructive dialogue, you opted for unilateral action, dragging everyone into your personal crusade against WP Engine.\n\nThe way you’ve leveraged WordPress.org as a weapon against WP Engine sets a dangerous precedent. This isn’t just about security concerns, as you claim. It's about consolidating control under the pretense of altruism, all while fostering deeper conflict within the open-source ecosystem. Your \"mad king\" behavior, as some in the open-source community have dubbed it, risks tearing apart the very foundation that WordPress is built on.\n\nTo many, your actions seem less like stewardship and more like the tantrum of someone unwilling to share the sandbox. The fallout has already begun, with WordCamps distancing themselves from WP Engine, confusing community events with ill-communicated sponsorship bans, and forcing developers to navigate the chaos you’ve unleashed. Was this power grab really worth all the damage?\n\nYou’ve achieved incredible things with WordPress, but don’t let that legacy be overshadowed by reckless power plays. Restore trust by rethinking how you handle disputes—before the community you helped build becomes a battleground of commercial skirmishes and mistrust.\n\nTLDR \n\nMatt, stop being a dick.",

And we've used them for a long time, too. I think we've had the \"Unlimited License\" for 9 or 10 years. \n\nBut that doesn't matter, apparently. We aren't lining their pockets enough and they are just straight-up cancelling our plan and trying to force us on to something costing more than 3X our current price. \n\nWhat a joke. In case you didn't notice, Agatha -- there are probably a dozen or more caching plugins just as good as yours that we can switch our customers over to.

Nothing fancy — just habits that stuck:  \n  \n  \n  \n• I always check if there are any codes floating around before checkout. Sometimes they only take off a couple dollars, sometimes more, but it adds up over time.  \n  \n• I compare the same item across a few different listings or platforms. Prices can vary more than you’d think.  \n  \n• If I’m not in a rush, I leave things in my cart for a day or two — a lot of sites push small discounts or reminders when they notice.  \n  \n• I avoid buying single low-cost items with shipping; bundling things usually makes it cheaper overall.  \n  \n• And if I’m on AliExpress specifically (US), the checkout codes sometimes stack with ongoing deals, so I test them just in case.  \n\n（$2 off $10 → CHIP2 ，$5 off $25 → CHIP5 ，$7 off $35 → CHIP7 ，$10 off $50 →CHIP10 ，$14 off $70 → CHIP14， $20 off $100 →CHIP20 ，$25 off $125 → CHIP25）  \n  \n  \nNothing groundbreaking, but these tiny things have saved me a bit here and there.",

I spent $500 comparing HeadshotPro, Aragon AI, Secta Labs, Looktara, and Profile Bakery, looking closely at image quality, speed, versatility, cost, and how they fit into a typical content workflow.\n\n* [HeadshotPro](http://headshotpro.com) created highly realistic, professional photos super fast, but it’s best for one-off shoots since there’s no way to generate extra images later.\n* [Aragon AI](http://aragon.ai) stood out for its wide variety and remix options, but the results sometimes felt a bit “AI” and it was slower.\n* [Secta Labs](http://secta.ai) delivered truly studio-level quality, great for corporate use, though it was pricey and not as customizable for daily creators.\n* [Looktara](http://looktara.com) was game-changing: once trained, I could make new headshots in seconds, tailored to my content, and the unlimited generation model paired with features like WhatsApp integration made it ideal for anyone posting regularly.\n* [Profile Bakery](http://profilebakery.com) worked best for job hunters who want a fast, polished update, though with less flexibility or style variety.\n\nFor those who post a lot, Looktara’s sub makes sense: instead of paying $50 every time for fresh photos, the annual fee covers unlimited images that match any mood—a feature that helped me easily switch up my look between LinkedIn content and event announcements.\n\nQuick takeaway:\n\n* [HeadshotPro](http://headshotpro.com) is great if you only need headshots once or twice.\n* [Looktara](http://looktara.com) shines for founders and content creators doing multiple posts a week it’s cost-effective and fits right into a busy workflow.\n* If you’re in between, the other tools all deliver strong results, each with their own strengths and quirks.\n\nLet me know if you want to hear more about the details, or how each tool handled real-world posting needs!",

      "selftext": "Everyone shares their growth wins. Nobody shares actual ROI data with time invested and conversion rates. For FounderToolkit, I tracked 75 early-stage SaaS products from $0 to first 1,000 users, documenting every tactic they tried with real results.\n\nHigh ROI Growth Tactics (What Actually Worked):\n\nDirectory Launches - Best Early ROI\nSystematic submission to 20+ startup directories over focused 2-week period. Directories used: Product Hunt, BetaList, launching.io, MicroLaunch, SaaSHub, TopStartups, StartupBuffer, AlternativeTo, StackShare, Capterra free tier, GetApp free tier, Launching Next, Startup Inspire, BetaPage, plus niche directories.\n\nCost: $0-200 (most free, some charge $20-50 for featured placement). Time invested: 10-15 hours total spread across 2 weeks. Result: 50-100 signups consistently, 5-12 converting to paying customers. Conversion rate: 8-12% from signup to paid. ROI: Absolute best time-to-result ratio for cold launches. Used by 68% of successful companies in my study.\n\nSEO Content Marketing - Highest Long-Term ROI\nPublishing 3x per week targeting hyper-specific long-tail keywords with 10-50 monthly search volume. Topics: \"How to [task] without [expensive tool],\" \"[Competitor] alternative for [niche],\" \"[Problem] solution for [audience].\" Post length: 1,200-1,800 words focusing on genuinely solving problems.\n\nCost: $0 if self-written, $200-500/month if outsourced. Time invested: 6-10 hours weekly for writing and publishing. Result: Zero traffic months 1-3 (this kills most founders' motivation), 500-2K monthly visitors by month 6, exponential growth after. Conversion rate: 8-15% because search intent matches solution. ROI: Highest long-term but requires 3-6 month patience. 100% of companies who published consistently for 3+ months saw meaningful traffic.\n\nCommunity Value-First - Best for Early Users\nContributing 50-100 genuinely helpful comments in target communities (Reddit, forums, Slack groups) over 4-6 weeks before ever mentioning product. Building reputation as helpful expert first, not link-dropper.\n\nCost: $0. Time invested: 2-3 hours weekly for 4-6 weeks. Result: When eventually posting own content or mentioning product in context, averaged 15-30 signups per authentic post. Conversion rate: 6-9% signup to paid. ROI: Best channel for acquiring first 50-100 users and getting product feedback. 71% of successful bootstrapped companies used this approach.\n\nNegative ROI Tactics (What Burned Time/Money):\n\nPaid Ads Before PMF - 92% Failure Rate\n43 of 75 companies tried Google/Facebook ads under $5K MRR. 41 lost money. CAC $100-300 per signup, LTV not proven, funnels not optimized, messaging not dialed. Only 2 succeeded both had prior exits and knew exactly what they were doing.\n\nInfluencer Outreach - Near Zero Success\n28 companies tried reaching out to YouTubers, podcast hosts, Twitter influencers. 2 got responses, zero saw meaningful ROI. Influencers don't respond to unknown companies with no traction.\n\nConference Sponsorships - 100% Regret Rate\n12 companies tried sponsoring/exhibiting at conferences under $10K MRR. Every single one regretted spending $2K-5K for 3-8 signups total. Conferences work at later stages.\n\nGeneric Cold Email - 2% Response Rate\n35 companies tried cold email with templates. Average response: 2%. Average conversion: near zero. The 12% who succeeded spent 3+ minutes per email with deep personalization. Only worth it for $500+/year products.\n\nThe Winning Pattern:\nSuccessful companies combined directories (immediate traction) + community value-first (early users + feedback) + consistent SEO (long-term growth). Total spend: $0-300 first year. Reached $10K+ MRR through execution on free channels.\n\nComplete breakdown of all 75 companies' tactics, timelines, costs, and results in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) with screenshots and specific numbers.",

      "selftext": "\nStarted service business in May with $3200 savings and zero marketing budget. Couldn't afford advertising so had to figure out organic customer acquisition. Six months later at $14K monthly revenue with 86% from organic search. Sharing complete growth playbook.​\n\nThe business growth challenge was competing against established companies spending thousands monthly on advertising. As bootstrapped startup couldn't afford $80-150 per lead on Google Ads. Needed sustainable acquisition channel that didn't drain capital.​\n\nThe organic growth strategy had three components. First, established online presence by submitting to 200+ directories via [this tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org) for $127 getting listed across the web. Second, optimized Google Business Profile with complete information and weekly updates. Third, published helpful content targeting customer questions.​\n\nMonth-by-month revenue showed month one invested in foundation zero revenue, month two got first organic visitors and inquiry calls, month three hit $2600 revenue from 6 customers found organically, month four grew to $5800 revenue as rankings improved, month five reached $9400 revenue with systematic review generation, and month six crossed $14K monthly as momentum built.​\n\nWhat specifically drove growth was hyper-local keyword targeting like \"service + specific neighborhood\" not broad terms, asking every satisfied customer for Google review building social proof, ensuring perfect business data consistency across all 200+ online listings, creating content answering common questions not just promoting services, and being patient through first 60 days building foundation.​\n\nCost over 6 months was minimal. Directory service $127 one-time, Google Business Profile free just time investment, hosting $18 monthly, review generation system $15 monthly, content writing own time 6 hours weekly. Total investment under $350 to reach $14K monthly revenue.​\n\nThe customer acquisition economics show the advantage. Organic customers cost essentially zero beyond initial foundation investment. Competitors paying $80-150 per lead need much higher revenue to stay profitable. We're highly profitable at $14K monthly while they need $25K+ to justify advertising costs.​\n\nTime investment was real early on. First 3 months spent 15-18 hours weekly on content, Google Business Profile, and learning. Months 4-6 dropped to 8-10 hours weekly as processes became routine and automated. Sweat equity but sustainable unlike burning money on ads.​\n\nFor businesses trying to grow without advertising the playbook is week one submit to directories establishing online presence everywhere, optimize Google Business Profile and update weekly, publish helpful content consistently even if just twice monthly, ask every happy customer for review, track what generates leads in Search Console, give it 90 days minimum before evaluating results, and reinvest early revenue into more content not advertising.​\n\nThe growth compounding effect is real. Content published in month two still generates customers in month six. Reviews collected in month three still improve rankings in month six. The work compounds while advertising costs are purely linear.​\n\nLooking ahead we'll hit $20K monthly by month 9 maintaining current trajectory without advertising. That's sustainable profitable growth versus ad-dependent revenue that disappears when budget gets cut. The organic foundation we built creates long-term competitive advantage.",

      "selftext": "\nStarted my business 14 months ago with $2000 in savings and zero marketing budget. Couldn't afford Facebook ads, Google ads, or any paid acquisition. Had to figure out how to get customers through free channels. Here's what actually worked to get us to $15K monthly recurring revenue.\n\nMonth one through three was pure foundation with almost no revenue. The strategy was building organic visibility that would compound over time instead of paid ads that stop working when budget runs out. Started with Google Business Profile optimization, submitting to every relevant directory, and getting our website indexed properly.\n\nThe specific tactic that moved the needle was systematic directory submissions. Our business needed credibility signals and backlinks to rank in Google. Used [this tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to submit to 200+ directories for $127 because manually doing it would've taken two full weekends. This gave our domain authority the initial boost from 0 to 14 in first 30 days.\n\nMonth four through six showed early traction. Started appearing in local search results for our service keywords. Got first organic customer inquiries through website contact form. Conversion rate was solid at 35% because people finding us organically were actively looking for solutions. Revenue hit $2000 MRR by month six, enough to cover basic expenses.\n\nContent strategy kicked in during months seven through nine. Published two blog posts per week targeting low-competition keywords with clear search intent. Focused on \"how to\" guides and comparison content that our target customers were searching for. The foundation backlinks from earlier meant this content actually ranked instead of sitting buried on page 8.\n\nMonths ten through twelve accelerated growth. Content was ranking for 40+ keywords bringing consistent traffic. Organic inquiries increased to 20-25 per month with same 35% conversion rate. Revenue reached $8500 MRR. Customer acquisition cost was basically zero compared to competitors spending $200-400 per customer on ads.\n\nMonth thirteen and fourteen focused on optimization. Improved website conversion rate from 35% to 42% through better copywriting and clearer calls-to-action. Started ranking for more competitive keywords as domain authority increased to 28. Revenue crossed $15K MRR with 89% coming from organic search and referrals.\n\nThe growth tactics that specifically worked were directory submissions for initial authority, consistent content publishing twice weekly targeting longtail keywords, local SEO optimization for geographic service terms, email sequences to nurture leads who weren't ready immediately, and asking happy customers for Google reviews which improved local rankings.\n\nWhat didn't work was trying to compete for high-volume keywords early on. Waste of time when domain authority is low. Also tried some social media marketing which brought brand awareness but zero actual customers. Reddit participation in relevant communities worked better for trust building.\n\nThe cost breakdown over 14 months was minimal. Directory submission service $127 one-time. Website hosting $12 monthly. Email marketing tool $20 monthly. Total investment was under $500 to get to $15K MRR. Compare that to paid acquisition where you'd spend $5000-10000 to reach similar revenue levels.\n\nThe time investment was significant though. First 6 months averaged 60 hours per month on content and SEO work alongside building the actual business. Months 7-14 averaged 40 hours monthly as processes got more efficient. This is real sweat equity but costs nothing except time.\n\nFor other business owners trying to grow without ad budget, the path is boring but effective. Build SEO foundation early through backlinks and directories. Publish content consistently targeting keywords customers actually search. Optimize conversion rate so organic traffic converts well. Be patient through the first 90 days when nothing seems to work.\n\nThe compound effect is the key advantage over paid ads. Money spent on ads today brings customers today but stops the minute budget runs out. SEO and content work done in month one still brings customers in month fourteen. The returns compound while costs stay fixed.\n\nThe next phase for us is adding paid ads now that we have revenue and understand customer economics. But organic will remain the foundation because CAC is negligible and it compounds. Most businesses do it backwards, blowing budget on ads before building organic channels.",

Documents, bank setup, onboarding clients, all that. Everything was moving smoothly. But the EIN? Total curveball.  \n  \n  \nI figured it’d take a week or two, but it’s been over a month now and still nothing. It’s the one thing holding us back from operating fully. Can’t open certain accounts, can’t finalize some contracts, it’s just this weird limbo. To add to it, I’ve got a business partner who’s all about planning and precision. We mapped out everything, but this delay caught us off guard. Now we’re holding back a couple of clients just because we don’t have this one thing.  \n  \nNo one really talked about this in all the research I did. I ended up finding this site where people anonymously share their EIN wait times, I’ve been checking it like every two hours at this point just to stay sane.  \n  \nSo yeah, is this kind of delay normal? Did we mess something up? Curious to hear if others have been through this especially if you applied from outside the US.",

      "selftext": "Not every automation tool delivers significant results; some simply save time while others genuinely increase traffic. Here are four tools that made a difference for me as I bootstrapped a SaaS company without a brand or a content team. I focus on organic growth, not paid methods.\n\nThese four tools contributed to my success:\n\n[Tally.so](http://tally.so) - **Lead Collection and Feedback**\n\nI utilized Tally for capturing early interest, onboarding questions, and even pre-launch surveys. The analytics and integration with Airtable provided valuable insights into user engagement.\n\n[Phantombuster](https://phantombuster.com) - **Outreach Automation**\n\nI used Phantombuster to scrape LinkedIn and Twitter startup directories, automating outreach for guest posts and link swaps. While it’s not perfect, proper targeting and warm messaging yielded real results.\n\n[GetMoreBacklinks.org](http://getmorebacklinks.org) - **SEO Distribution**\n\nThis tool automated over 500 directory submissions, niche listing sites, and citation links. As a result, my Domain Rating (DR) improved from 0 to 9 in just 30 days. There was no need to chase backlinks or manage spreadsheets—just efficient bulk SEO distribution, ideal for early-stage products. The best part? It's founder-run and tailored specifically for SaaS startups.\n\n\n[Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com) - **Real-Time Insights**\n\nI switched from Google Analytics to Fathom for a simpler experience. Fathom helped me identify which links generated clicks, determined which channels brought in converting users, and indicated when to focus my efforts.\n\nThese tools aren't magic and they won't go viral, but they are reliable, time-tested solutions that enabled me to build an effective marketing machine. Feel free to ask me anything about these tools. I'm happy to share my workflows or any mistakes I made during the setup process!\n",

      "selftext": "I used to think that SEO was something only large teams with extensive resources and expensive agencies could accomplish. However, I've discovered that a few smart tools and a bit of discipline can make a significant difference — even for a solo builder like me.\n\nLast month, I focused entirely on automation and scaled my traffic from almost nothing to around 1,400 organic visitors in just under 30 days. I achieved this without any content marketing or ads. Instead, I relied on four tools that handled the heavy lifting in terms of backlinks, site audits, email outreach, and on-page improvements.\n\nHere’s the stack I used:\n\n[NeuronWriter](https://neuronwriter.com): I used this tool to rewrite and optimize my existing pages based on what the top-ranking competitors were doing. It’s much easier to use than Surfer or Clearscope, and as a result, my bounce rate dropped significantly.\n\n[Instantly.ai](http://instantly.ai): I employed this for cold outreach to secure backlinks and partnerships. The personalization features, along with the warm-up inbox option, ensured that my emails received responses.\n\n[GetMoreBacklinks.org](http://getmorebacklinks.org): I found this tool while searching for startup directories. It manages directory submissions, niche listing sites, and even provides a checklist for boosting your domain authority. I submitted my site to approximately 150 directories, and my domain rating increased from 1 to 7 in just three weeks. The entire process took about 15 minutes.\n\n[Ubersuggest](http://ubersuggest.zendesk.com/hc/en-us): This tool is helpful for quick keyword validation and basic audit reports. While it’s not perfect, it provides enough insight to guide my content adjustments.\n\nNow, I operate on a weekly cadence: submissions on Monday, content tweaks on Wednesday, and outreach on Friday.\n\nIf you’re in the early stages of building your online presence, I suggest skipping the creation of 30 blog posts and instead starting with this automated loop. While SEO results don’t appear instantly, making the right moves early on can create compounding benefits.",

That killed recall.\n\nMid sprint I tried [looktara.com](http://looktara.com). You upload 30 solo photos once. It trains a private model of you in about 10 minutes. Then you can create unlimited solo photos that look like a clean phone shot. It is made by a LinkedIn creators community for daily posters. Private. Deletable. No group composites. I added one photo to every post. The face created recall.\n\nTool 2 Writing and ideas A single notes app with a simple template. Hook. Pain. Tiny proof. Lesson. Ask. I wrote in short lines. I kept a library of 30 prompts that match my offers.\n\nTool 3 Scheduler and checklist One slot per day. One theme per weekday. A five point checklist before I hit post. Photo matches topic. CTA matches offer. Track UTM. Save comments to CRM.\n\nTool 4 Analytics I actually read Profile visits. CTR to profile. DM reply rate. Comment quality. I logged words like see and recognize. Those words predict revenue better than likes.\n\nMy 40 day rules Post at the same time. One face photo per post. One background per week. Delete anything uncanny without debate. Say it is AI if asked. Never fake locations.\n\nNumbers that moved 3K to 10K total followers in 40 days. Two weeks of higher profile visits. DM reply rate doubled. I closed my first brand deal on day 33. Small, but real.\n\nWhy this worked People remember people. Faces create recall. Recall drives replies. Replies open deals. Automation removed excuses. I just showed up.\n\nSEO phrases I searched and used once automate personal branding best AI headshot for LinkedIn founder led sales images content calendar for creators no photoshoot daily posts\n\nCopy my playbook Build a 12 photo starter pack in looktara. Store 30 prompts for your niche. Pick one daily slot and stick to it. Measure profile visits and DM replies. Listen for see and recognize in comments. Iterate on vibe, not on volume.\n\nCaveats This does not replace real photographers for events. It fills weekday gaps. Be honest with your audience. Keep likeness true.\n\nIf you want my templates I can paste the prompt list, the checklist, and the tracking sheet. If you ran a similar sprint share what moved first for you. Background. Expression. Or the CTA.\n\n ",

      "selftext": "Ok so I manage social for 5 different brand accounts and was literally spending my entire morning (like 3+ hours) just trying to create content. Every. Single. Day.\n\nI jumped on the ChatGPT train back in March thinking it would save me. Spoiler: it didnt. The content was so generic and boring. Our engagement actually dropped because everything sounded like it came from the same robot (because it did lol).\n\nThe problem I finally figured out is that even with web browsing, ChatGPT cant efficiently scan through dozens of industry sources every day. And the API version doesnt have browsing at all. So I was either manually feeding it info (which took forever) or getting generic content that wasnt relevant to current industry conversations.\n\nAnyway after 3 months of frustration I basically said screw it and built something different.\n\nThe breakthrough was setting up automated data collection that runs every morning. It pulls from our top 10 industry blogs, trending Reddit/Twitter discussions in our niche, what competitors are posting publicly, any new industry reports etc. Then feeds all that into ChatGPT API in a structured way.\n\nThis all dumps into a Google Sheet every morning. Then I have a Make workflow that takes all that data, feeds it to ChatGPT with my prompts, and spits out like 5-7 post ideas with copy.\n\nI still review everything for like 20-30 mins because AI can be weird sometimes (last week it tried to reference a \"study\" that didnt exist lol). But the quality is SO much better now because its actually informed by whats happening in our space.\n\nAfter I approve stuff it goes straight to Buffer and publishes automatically.\n\nBeen running this for 3 months now and went from 3 hours/day to 30 mins, engagement is up like 20%, actually growing followers again (up 35%), and it costs me about $80/month vs the $800+ I was quoted to hire someone.\n\nThe whole thing took me like 2 days to set up and honestly I should have done this way earlier.\n\nAnyway just wanted to share in case anyone else is struggling with the same thing.

      "selftext": "If you're only chasing SaaS and tech clients, you're leaving 80% of the market untapped. I spent 3 years doing digital marketing for \"s3xy\" startups. Competitive as hell, clients expect miracles on shoestring budgets, everyone and their dog is an \"expert\" in that space. Then I stumbled into working with a moving company and it was like finding a cheat code.\n\nWhy unglamorous industries are marketing gold:\n\n1. Low digital maturity = massive quick wins Most service businesses are YEARS behind on digital best practices. I'm talking websites from 2012, zero SEO strategy, competing purely on price. You can implement basics and see solid improvements in reasonable timeframes.\n2. Less competition for talent Everyone wants to work for the cool tech startup. Almost nobody's excited about \"moving company marketing.\" Which means the few specialists who DO focus there can charge better rates and actually stand out.\n3. Proven business models These aren't startups burning VC cash hoping for product-market fit. They're established businesses with real revenue who just suck at marketing. Way easier to grow something that already works.\n\nMoving company doing $220K annual revenue, stuck for 2 years. Owner thought more trucks = more growth. Wrong. Problem was visibility - ranking page 3 on Google, mediocre GMB profile, inconsistent review flow.\n\nPartnered with [mover marketing ai](https://www.movermarketing.ai/services) guys doing marketing (that specialize in moving industry marketing) to fix the fundamentals: local SEO, Map Pack optimization, review automation, geo-targeted landing pages.\n\n10 months later - $340K annual revenue. Not overnight success, but steady growth with same team size. Just fixed the marketing funnel.\n\nThe opportunity: There are 7,000+ moving companies in the US alone. Each one needs: SEO, PPC, web design, social media, CRM implementation. Most have NEVER worked with a real digital marketer.\n\nMultiply that across HVAC (130K+ companies), plumbing (120K+), roofing, pest control, landscaping... you get the picture.\n\nWhy marketers avoid these industries? I think it's ego. It's not s3xy to say you do SEO for plumbers. But you know what IS better? $3K-$5K monthly retainers with clients who stick around because you're driving actual leads.\n\nAnyone else working in \"uns3xy\" verticals?",

Here are the results after 4 months: [https://imgur.com/a/kPOzGet](https://imgur.com/a/kPOzGet)\n\nWent from 3 clicks/day to 450 clicks/day. Completely hands-off.\n\nHere's the full breakdown of what the automation does:\n\n**1. Website scanning &amp; context gathering**\n\nThe system crawls our entire site to understand our brand voice, existing content structure, and internal linking opportunities. This was something our agency never did properly - their content always felt generic.\n\n**2. Keyword research &amp; competitor analysis**\n\nAutomatically identifies keyword gaps by analyzing what competitors rank for that we don't. No more spreadsheets or manual SERP analysis.\n\n**3. Content generation with reasoning**\n\nUses advanced AI (not basic ChatGPT) to write articles that actually match our tone. The key difference from DIY AI content: it's built specifically for SEO with proper structure, headers, and optimization.\n\n**4. Internal linking**\n\nEvery article automatically includes relevant internal links to our existing content. This was something our agency always \"forgot\" to do.\n\n**5. Image creation**\n\nGenerates custom images for each post. No more hunting for stock photos or paying designers.\n\n**6. Auto-publishing to CMS**\n\nConnects directly to our CMS and publishes daily without any manual intervention. We literally set it and forget it.\n\n**7. Indexing optimization**\n\nSubmits new content for faster indexing so we're not waiting weeks for Google to discover pages.\n\n**The math that made this obvious:**\n\nAgency: $3,800/month for 2 articles = $1,900/article\n\nOur automated setup: \\~$100/month for 30 articles = $3.33/article\n\nWe're publishing 15x more content at 1/600th the cost per article.\n\n**What surprised us most:**\n\nThe content quality is genuinely better than what our agency produced. Probably because the system actually analyzes our site and competitors instead of having a junior copywriter Google the topic for 10 minutes.\n\nHappy to share more details on the setup if anyone's interested. Took about 3 months to build the full workflow but now it just runs on autopilot.",

      "selftext": "I see a lot of founders in this sub paying $2,000 - $4,000/month for SEO agencies. Usually, the deliverable is generic blog posts a month that never rank.\n\nI decided to take a different approach. Instead of hiring a writer, I architected a custom \"Content Engine.\"\n\nI recently deployed this for a project in the automotive niche. **The Result:** We went from **0 to 19,000 impressions in 6 months** completely on autopilot. *(I can't post images here, but if you want to see the Google Search Console graph, feel free to DM me).*\n\n**The Economics (Why I built this)**\n\n* **Agency Model:** $3,000/mo for 8 articles = **$375 per article.**\n* **Automation Model:** One-time build + \\~$50/mo API costs for \\~60 articles = **$0.83 per article.**\n\nBut here is the catch: You cannot get these results with a simple \"Make/n8n &gt; GPT\" wrapper. You have to build a system that mimics a human strategist.\n\n**The Architecture (The Stack)** I used **Make.com** for the orchestration, **DataForSEO** for the live metrics, and **OpenAI** for the generation. Here is the 5-layer workflow:\n\n**1. Context Injection (The Brain)** Most scripts fail because they have no memory. This system starts by pulling specific **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)** and **Brand Voice Guidelines** from my database. It never writes a word without knowing *who* it is selling to.\n\n**2. The Discovery Layer (Live Data via DataForSEO)** The system uses the DataForSEO API to hunt for live keywords. It doesn't guess; it filters for:\n\n* High Volume\n* Low Difficulty\n* Topical Relevance\n\n**3. The Strategy Layer (Clustering)** You can't rank with random posts. The Make scenario runs a clustering logic to map out a \"Hub and Spoke\" model, determining which article is the Pillar Page and which are the supporting clusters *before* it starts writing.\n\n**4. The Analysis Layer (Competitor Scraping)** This is the secret sauce. The system scrapes the top 3 live Search Results for the target keyword. It analyzes:\n\n* What headings are they using?\n* What is the average word count?\n* What sub-topics are they covering?\n* Crucially: What are they missing?\n\nIt identifies the content gaps so your article provides value that the current ranking pages do not.\n\n**5. The Execution Layer (Agentic Drafting)** I use a chain of OpenAI modules to write the content section-by-section (to avoid context loss).\n\n* **Visuals:** Auto-generates blog covers and social media assets (Nano Banana Pro).\n* **Meta:** Writes CTR-optimized descriptions.\n* **Sync:** Pushes the HTML draft directly to WordPress and schedules social media post\n\n**A Warning on \"Software Rot\"** If you try to build this yourself on Make, do **not** \"set and forget.\" Automation is brittle. APIs change, and models drift. I treat this like a software product, not a script. It requires what I call \"Hyper Care\" monitoring the output for the first 30 days to dial in the prompt temperatures. If you don't audit the machine, the quality drops fast.\n\n**Summary** Stop paying $2k retainers for generic content. Build a system. Inject Context. Research Keywords. Cluster Topics. Analyze Competitors. Then execute.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the Make modules or the DataForSEO endpoints I used!",

Create a referral program where current customers can refer friends and family to your business in exchange for discounts or free services.\n\n5. Collaborate with local pet stores and offer a \"bundle deal\" where customers can purchase grooming services and pet supplies at a discounted price.\n\n6. Host a \"doggy fashion show\" event, showcasing the before and after grooming transformations of your customers' dogs. This will not only be a fun and unique event, but also a great opportunity to showcase your skills and the quality of your grooming services.\n\nHere's a follow-up refinement: \"Could you tailor the campaigns for St. Patrick's Day promotions?\"\n\nThe ChatGPT response:\n\nSure! Here are six unique, creative, and innovative campaign ideas for marketing a new dog grooming business with a St. Patrick's Day theme:\n\n1. Offer a \"Lucky Dog\" package, which includes a full grooming service and a special St. Patrick's Day-themed accessory (such as a green bandana or bowtie).\n\n2. Host a \"St. Paws Day\" parade where customers can bring their dogs in costume and participate in a march around the neighborhood. Offer a discount on grooming services to all participants.\n\n3. Create a \"Pot of Gold\" referral program, where current customers can refer friends and family to your business in exchange for discounts or free services. For every successful referral, customers can \"find\" a virtual gold coin and redeem it for prizes or discounts.\n\n4. Collaborate with a local Irish pub and offer a \"Pint and a Groom\" package, where customers can enjoy a drink at the pub while their dog gets pampered at your salon.\n\n5. Host a St. Patrick's Day-themed doggy photo shoot, where customers can have professional photos taken of their dogs in festive costumes or against a green background. Offer a discount on grooming services to all participants.\n\n6. Offer a special St. Patrick's Day-themed grooming service, which includes a shamrock-shaped haircut or a green dye job. This will be a unique and memorable offering for customers looking to celebrate the holiday with their pets.\n\nAnother follow-up prompt: \"Could you generate six taglines to go with the campaigns?\"\n\n1. \"Lucky dogs get pampered at [Business Name]\"\n\n2. \"Celebrate St. Paws Day with [Business Name]\"\n\n3. \"Get your pot of gold at [Business Name] with our referral program\"\n\n4. \"Pint and a groom - the perfect St. Patrick's Day combo\"\n\n5. \"Get your dog in the St. Patrick's Day spirit with our festive grooming services\"\n\n6. \"Find your luck at [Business Name] with our St. Patrick's Day specials\"\n\nAnd one final prompt: \"Awesome. How about something even more creative, with metaphor and in six words or less each?\"\n\nThe ChatGPT response:\n\nSure! Here are six creative taglines, using metaphor and six words or less, for a new dog grooming business:\n\n1. \"Groomed to perfection, like a four-legged leprechaun\"\n\n2. \"Fur-tastic transformations at the end of the rainbow\"\n\n3. \"Where every dog is a pot of gold\"\n\n4. \"Your dog's mane-tenance headquarters\"\n\n5. \"Polished pooches, every time\"\n\n6. \"Bark less, wag more with a grooming from us\"\n\nNote: I just put \"six\" for simplicity's sake, but you could put as many ideas as you want it to generate. You can also refine prompts endlessly; this was just a quick demonstration. ChatGPT is an AMAZING tool, for ideation of nothing else.",

It's overwhelming.  \n\nI don't use AI to comb through these, but I cannot give every resume careful consideration when I'm trying to go through a few hundred per day while also keeping on top of business as usual.  With that said, only about 1 in 50 or so bother to attach a cover letter.  While I don't have the time to read every resume beyond a quick 1 minute (or less) scan, I do read every cover letter.  I figure if someone takes the time to tell me why they think they're a good fit, I owe them the courtesy of reading it. On the other hand, I give the 1 click apply from Indeed applicants about the same amount of time they took to apply to the position. \n\nSo for those of you looking for a new position, If you find a job that you think is actually a great fit, I would encourage you to take the time to write and apply a cover letter.

      "selftext": "I have been doing email marketing for over a decade. Mistakes happen, but I got my biggest client ever last year: a dried fruit company that you may have seen on supermarket shelves. In one of my promotional emails that went out to thousands of people, I thanked people for ordering, but forgot to segment the right audience, so everyone received a thank you (even those who hadn't purchased). We received a flood of replies from confused customers.\n\nIn response, I decided to make an \"Oops!\" email that apologized for the mistake, and positioned it to link to our new sale. I also created a new character, a bird that nested in a fruit tree, and made it the mascot for error emails going forward. \n\nThat \"Oops\" email generated over $20,000 in sales, our biggest single-email sales message since the company started email marketing. **The lessons:**\n\n**1. You can make mistakes, but apologize quickly and be honest.**\n\n**2. You can make light of the mistake, and even turn it into a sales opportunity.**\n\n**3. Be humble, and be authentic. People appreciated the apology email more than the actual sales emails!**",

      "title": "Warning: the r/agency subreddit is currently being auctioned off for $50,000 and is being used by mods to promote scams to marketers",
      "selftext": "First of all, I have been a long-time member and lurker of [r/agency](https://www.reddit.com/r/agency/) for a while. I’ve worked in marketing for quite some time and have been toying around with the idea of starting my own SMMA for a while now and that sub offered tons of useful info on that subject. There was always a little bit of self-promotion happening within the community by the owners (such as [u/ggildner](https://www.reddit.com/user/ggildner/) promoting his agency growth ebooks and whatnot) but it was interspersed between actually useful and valuable content so I saw no real harm there.\n\nHowever, a few weeks back, I noticed that a new mod was added to the subreddit. This was his very first contribution:\n\n[https://imgur.com/FNJ9F4v](https://imgur.com/FNJ9F4v)\n\nThis mod spoke in very obviously broken English which I thought was a little strange initially but I didn’t pay it much mind. He’s since edited this comment to make it a lot more legible but previously, it was literally incomprehensible gibberish as pointed out by [u/domestic-jones](https://www.reddit.com/user/domestic-jones/). It was weird but it can be overlooked as not everyone in this field is gonna be a great speaker (English is my second language too). However, at his level of proficiency, it was a bit ridiculous that he’d even be moderating an English-speaking community in the first place.\n\nThe thing that really put me on super high alert was this post here:\n\n[https://imgur.com/ZQhXsnK](https://imgur.com/ZQhXsnK)\n\nNot necessarily a strange post for this sub by any means, however, this comment was indeed highly strange:\n\n[https://imgur.com/079Qe4b](https://imgur.com/079Qe4b)\n\nJudging by the downvotes, it was clear I wasn’t the only one who immediately suspected this to be a scam. So you can imagine my surprise when I see this new so-called “mod” commented this in reply to the scammy comment:\n\n[https://imgur.com/J5aLDc8](https://imgur.com/J5aLDc8)\n\n[https://imgur.com/n787ec7](https://imgur.com/n787ec7)\n\nThis is when I knew for a fact that this wasn’t your average mod and this dude has just been given the ultimate license to promote whichever scams he wanted on this sub. I started monitoring this “mod’s” activity and found more examples of him advertising this scammy protonmail email:\n\n[https://imgur.com/b8H2s44](https://imgur.com/b8H2s44)\n\nHe published this on a post that was over a year old. On top of that, when I checked his account again, I then witnessed this new account (that has a suspiciously similar writing style to the “mod” I might add) replied the following beneath their obviously promotional comment:\n\n[https://imgur.com/fXOSTM3](https://imgur.com/fXOSTM3)\n\nIt seems I wasn’t the only one that thought that was strange judging by [u/nutag](https://www.reddit.com/user/nutag/)’s comment:\n\n[https://imgur.com/kUwiQyl](https://imgur.com/kUwiQyl)\n\nHowever, when I went to check the Reddit activity of this so-called “satisfied customer”, I realized that it was the very same account that had left the original comment promoting the scammy protonmail email in the previous thread:\n\n[https://imgur.com/YQdxr06](https://imgur.com/YQdxr06)\n\nSo basically, this guy was recommending a clearly legit service that he himself used a year ago and then he “rediscovered” the same service provider through the mod’s comment on a one year old post and just had to express his gratitude for the mod’s suggestion? How stupid does this “mod” think his audience is?\n\nI started doing even more digging and then discovered that this subreddit is actually up for sale on a popular digital assets transfership forum: \n\n[https://imgur.com/iTAhZXb](https://imgur.com/iTAhZXb)\n\n[https://imgur.com/W0l5VKr](https://imgur.com/W0l5VKr)\n\n[https://imgur.com/lwmqXsf](https://imgur.com/lwmqXsf)\n\nThis sales listing was posted right around the same time that this new “mod” joined the subreddit and to this day, he is attempting to sell his moderatorship rights to the subreddit for a whopping $50,000. I messaged [u/ggildner](https://www.reddit.com/user/ggildner/) about this, notifying him of the fact that the sub is being listed for sale on an external forum by pretending to be a potential customer to see if he was in on it. However, he simply accepted my chat request and then said absolutely nothing, which leads me to believe that he is well aware of what is happening. The fact that he didn’t get rid of the new “mod” after I sent him a screenshot of the sales listing says all I needed to know. I messaged all of the other mods as well but no one responded to me about this, which means the accounts either all belong to the same people or they’re no longer even active on the platform.\n\nNow, I see this same “mod” attempting to take over another sub by the name of [r/FakeGuru](https://www.reddit.com/r/FakeGuru/):\n\n[https://imgur.com/ZqL0AHe](https://imgur.com/ZqL0AHe)\n\nCall me crazy but I can already envision this “mod” getting paid hefty sums to decide which gurus are fake and which are real. A continuation of his behaviour so far in the [r/agency](https://www.reddit.com/r/agency/) sub.\n\nI just want to bring this community's attention to what's happening over there as I'm sure there's a big overlap between the two communities. Do not trust what you see on there anymore, the mods are actively deleting info that is truthful and promoting info that aims to scam members of the sub. Beware.\n\nEdit: u/ggildner has already deleted all of his accounts that were previously mods from Reddit. I guess he had to much PII that tied his agency to the sub so he scrubbed everything clean. Name and shame works folks. Now just gotta get rid of the remaining scammer on the sub.\n\nEdit #2: Some positive news to report, it appears that r/agency has been purged of its moderator team. However, the bad news is that there is currently a r/redditrequest thread that I strongly believe was made by an alt account of the previous mod:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1hst5o4/request\\_ragency\\_because\\_no\\_mods\\_exist\\_there/\\\\](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1hst5o4/request_ragency_because_no_mods_exist_there/%5C)\n\nThe reason I suspect this is because this was the account that published the original thread ([https://imgur.com/ZQhXsnK](https://imgur.com/ZQhXsnK)) where the mod first introduced the scammy protonmail. I initially didn’t think much of it but after looking very deeply through this account’s history, the writing style and the misspellings are all very eerily similar to the previous mod’s writing style:\n\n[https://imgur.com/85HqHSr](https://imgur.com/85HqHSr)\n\nI believe he orchestrated this post as a precursor to the astroturfing campaign to introduce the “reputation fixer” protonmail address as the mod-approved savior. Why wait for someone else to post something relevant when you can just do it yourself to get your ad seen?\n\nI also find it strange that just like the mod account, this account’s last activity prior to becoming active on the r/agency sub was well over two years ago. Writing style was completely different from the comments they made back in 2022 in comparison to their writing style now. I obviously don’t have as much proof to back up these claims as I did in my original expose but my gut is telling me it is the same exact person behind it.\n\nOn top of that, I see u/ggildner attempting to become a mod in the sub again:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1hsu47x/comment/m588jf4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/1hsu47x/comment/m588jf4/)\n\nDespite literally commenting on the now deleted r/digital_marketing post that he was now “too busy” to moderate and gave away all his subs. He’s since edited the comment to say something completely but this is still pretty damning if you ask me:\n\n[https://imgur.com/MwrwDiq](https://imgur.com/MwrwDiq)\n\nWhy would you want to go back if you felt the need to leave in the first place? Please make it make sense u/ggildner. I tried to submit a new request on r/redditrequest but they didn’t allow me due to the 15 day rule:\n\n[https://imgur.com/5WWzuAY](https://imgur.com/5WWzuAY)\n\nI had submitted one yesterday trying to get them to replace the mods so I guess I’m shit out of luck. To be frank, I don’t have a super burning desire to moderate the community in the first place but I sincerely hope that none of these guys ever get added to the mod list again. In any case though, I consider this situation to be a win, just hoping there won’t be a round two of the same old.\n\n",

      "title": "A peculiar insight into the click fraud problem on Twitter",
      "selftext": "Hi all\n\nLet me first explain how click fraud usually works:\n\n1. A scammer creates a website and contacts an ad network like Google Ads, Microsoft Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Twitter Ads, etc. and opens a publisher advertising account. This allows him to monetize his website by placing ads on it.\n\n2. Instead of waiting for real people to visit his website and click on the ads, he uses stealth bots (e.g. puppeteer-extra and its stealth plugin) to visit his website and click on the ads.\n\nHe'll also use residential proxies to fake his IP address for every click, and fake his device fingerprint, but the basic idea is he sends bots to his website to click on the ads.\n\nWe look at over 100 million ad clicks every month (checking them for click fraud), so we have pretty good data about the state of the industry.\n\nMost ad networks have two places you can show your ads: on the platform itself (e.g. on the twitter app) or on the ad platform's audience network (e.g. third party websites displaying twitter ads). Since criminals earn their money by showing ads on their own websites, that means most click fraud happens on the audience network. As an example, LinkedIn Ads has a click fraud rate of 61%, and only 3% of those clicks happen on the LinkedIn platform itself. The other 97% occur on the LinkedIn audience network.\n\nTwitter is an exception. The majority of its click fraud is happening on the Twitter platform itself. There's *a lot* of bots clicking on the ads. This is peculiar, since scammers have no financial incentive to do this. In fact, not only will they not earn any money from this, but they'll lose money, as they have to maintain their bots, run servers, pay for residential proxies, and so on.\n\nI suspect activists are targeting Twitter with click fraud bots to damage the company by causing its advertisers to flee.",

The 16TB collection includes over 311,000 datasets harvested during 2024 and 2025, a complete archive of federal public datasets linked by data.gov. It will be updated daily as new datasets are added to data.gov.\n\n&gt;This is the first release in our new [data vault project](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2025/01/30/preserving-public-u-s-federal-data/) to preserve and authenticate vital public datasets for academic research, policymaking, and public use.\n\n&gt;We’ve built this project on our long-standing commitment to preserving government records and making public information available to everyone. Libraries play an essential role in safeguarding the integrity of digital information. By preserving detailed metadata and establishing digital signatures for authenticity and provenance, we make it easier for researchers and the public to cite and access the information they need over time.\n\n&gt;In addition to the data collection, we are releasing [open source software and documentation](https://github.com/harvard-lil/data-vault) for replicating our work and creating similar repositories. With these tools, we aim not only to preserve knowledge ourselves but also to empower others to save and access the data that matters to them.\n\n&gt;For suggestions and collaboration on future releases, please contact us at [lil@law.harvard.edu](mailto:lil@law.harvard.edu).\n\n&gt;This project builds on our work with the [Perma.cc](https://perma.cc/) web archiving tool used by courts, law journals, and law firms; the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law/), sharing all precedential cases of the United States; and our research on [Century Scale Storage](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/century-scale-storage/). This work is made possible with support from the Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.\n\nYou can follow the Library Innovation on Bluesky [here](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:xwf6xvqychkupgnumbyoru5l).\n\n___\n\n***Edit (2025-02-07 at 01:30 UTC):***\n\nu/lyndamkellam, a university data librarian, makes an important caveat [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1ijhybf/comment/mbea3b4/).",

These changes are what killed pushshift.io (full reddit archives and searchable api used by mods and many research/academic papers) and what will kill most (if not all) third-party reddit clients. This is obviously a detriment to everyone, and while Reddit will almost certainly go through with these changes regardless, thousands of subreddits are going to be participating in a 2-day (or longer) blackout. You can read more about the blackouts at r/ModCoord. At the very least, the planned blackout seems to have convinced Reddit to give free API access to accessibility clients. Hopefully it can change their minds further.\n\nr/DataHoarder will be locked for an undetermined amount of time, see [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1479c7b/historic_reddit_archives_ongoing_archival_effort) for reddit data archives, tools, etc. we will also be using this time to update our sidebar links and do some general maintenance in the hopes that this mess doesn't mean the end for us and the many communities that see this as a killing of the Reddit we have loved over the years. \n\n**Note; during this time no new posts can be made and all comments are black-holed.** \n--------\n\n~ The Mod Team, ciao for now.\n\n--------------\n\nTrack the blackout here: https://reddark.untone.uk",

      "title": "My friend died from smoking. I decided to build an app to help myself quit.",
      "selftext": "Two months ago, a close friend of mine passed away from lung cancer. What shocked me the most was how fast everything happened. He went for annual health checkups every year and everything always came back “normal”. Then one day, he was diagnosed — and just three weeks later, he was gone. He left behind everything he had built in his life: his wife and two young daughters.\n\nThat hit me hard. I’ve been smoking for about 10 years. Around half a pack a day. I also do regular health checkups, and just like him, everything looks fine. But after what happened, I couldn’t stop thinking: what if it happens to me too? I don’t want to disappear that quickly because of cigarettes.\n\nI’ve tried quitting many times using willpower alone, and I always failed. I also didn’t want to use medication or see a doctor — not because I think they’re wrong, but because deep down I didn’t want to see myself as “an addict”.\n\nWhen I felt the most desperate, I stumbled onto a very simple idea — something close to mindfulness in Buddhism. Instead of trying to quit, I started **paying attention**.\n\nI took a notebook and wrote down every cigarette:\n\n* when I smoked\n* how many\n* why I smoked\n* how I felt afterward\n\nThat’s it. Nothing else. No pressure to quit. After about two weeks, something unexpected happened. I realized how much **time** I was wasting on smoking. Every cigarette meant going out to the balcony and standing there for about 5 minutes. When I added it all up, I was spending almost **an hour every day**, and nearly **6 hours a week**, just smoking.\n\nWriting down the reasons helped too. I started noticing clear triggers:\n\n* arguments with coworkers or my wife\n* after dinner\n* drinking alcohol\n\nI could *see* cravings coming before they hit. This didn’t make me quit overnight. But it changed how I *felt* about cigarettes. They stopped feeling like a “small joy” or a reward. They started feeling… unnecessary. The number of cigarettes I smoked dropped naturally. From about 10 a day to around 3–6.\n\nThe problem was that writing everything down was exhausting. I looked for apps, but none of them really fit what I needed. So I built one for myself. It’s extremely simple. One button per cigarette. That’s it. From there, I can see my data for today, this week, this month, this year. To strengthen my willpower, I added a small goal system. After each cigarette, I set a goal like “wait at least 2 hours before the next one”. At the end of the day, I can see how many times I succeeded — and how many times I failed.\n\nFor me, this has been the only method that actually works without medication or doctors. Doing this every day slowly changes your subconscious. It changes how you perceive smoking. I truly believe most of us can’t quit because deep down, we don’t really want to. We’ve associated cigarettes with comfort and relief, instead of seeing the real danger behind them.\n\nYou can absolutely do this with pen and paper like I did at first. But if you want something more convenient, you can try the app I made. It’s completely free, and all data is stored locally on your phone. I’m not trying to sell anything. I honestly just don’t want to see more people end up like my friend. I’d really appreciate any feedback or suggestions so I can improve it for people who are trying to quit.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n**iOS:**\n\n[https://apps.apple.com/app/6754150567](https://apps.apple.com/app/6754150567)\n\n**Android (Closed Test):**\n\nGoogle requires 13 testers.

      "selftext": "After years of trial and error, questioning myself, talking into the ether, self doubt, and probably a few lost hairs, I finally got my first app to 10k monthly revenue. \n\nWanted to share how I got here and hopefully inspire a few of you, especially if you don’t think there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. \n\n\n\n1) I made the app available for free to the first 500 (didn’t have payments in place). This allowed me to a) build up a user base whose needs I could better understand and then b) also boost ASO. The app itself doesn’t have too many AI features, so my costs for running it are fairly minimal. Those users then also became advocates for the app, which helped with word of mouth and early growth. \n\nThe app continues to operate on a freemium model, so around 70% of features remain free.\n\n\n\n2) The way I found those users was to post in relevant subreddits (don’t bother searching this account’s history, I used another account). The post themselves were phrased like “Hey, I built a free app for xyz and would love your feedback”. \n\nThe operating term here, I think, was free. Reddit users are allergic to being sold something, so by solving their problem for free, they would’ve looked like c\\*nts for shitting on me (esp since competing apps do charge). \n\n\n\n3) Build features customers of your competition request. Lucky enough, two of my competitors have public feature voting boards. I basically just scanned those and implemented the most requested ones, then used that in my marketing (e.g., content I made or in the App Store description) and within the app (e.g., during onboarding) wherever I could. \n\nAnd then obviously the features I now build are all based on user feedback and voting results as well. \n\n\n\n4) Next to Reddit, I have also been experimenting with TikTok a lot. It’s far and beyond the best platform to go from 0 to crazy revenue jump with just one successful piece of content. \n\nI started out with two accounts on my phone, one doing slideshows and one doing simple reaction videos. I’ve since expanded to 15 accounts across 4 phones. \n\nMy basic workflow is to warm up for 3-4 days, then create first few content pieces on phone, and then switching to a third-party scheduler, which has automations build in and also allows you to hire human UGC creators. I’ve now hired a VA from the Philippines who I pay $4/hr and she manages all the content using that platform. \n\n\n\n5) SEO starting to take off slowly but surely as well. I don’t do free tools or blog posts for now but have a few feature pages that are ranking well. But more importantly, the programmatic pages I set up are finally working. I basically scraped data from a few different sources, use some of our own (anonymized) data, and created around 450 pages that I let rest for a while. \n\nI just crossed 5k organic clicks a few days ago ([https://ibb.co/Y7t6p8Bp](https://ibb.co/Y7t6p8Bp)) and now get about 1-3 sales a day from SEO. Nothing crazy but this should scale linearly (assuming same customer demographics), which means at 50k clicks / month, which is not impossible to reach, I could probably make enough passively already to live off of SEO and not rely on organic anymore (which I’ll obv still continue pouring money and resources in because it is all related in the end). \n\n\n\nHope this little breakdown helps some of you guys currently struggling to get your apps off the ground.\n\n\n\nHappy to answer any questions you have :)",

      "selftext": "Here's what I know. Google has leading AI models. And they have access to more compute than anyone in history. \n\nThey could release the blueprint for what they're doing and no one would be able to keep up because of the sheer power they have. Same with every FAANG.\n\nThese companies always describe exactly what they're doing to dominate the market. For a very simple reason, it boosts stock price.\n\nSmall developers are also eerily quiet about how they're using these tools. You get very very generic responses from people with no solid understanding of what they're doing, how to audit it, or if it's even working/saving time. \n\nWhat I've seen in person is tons of broken products that aren't quite working, and llms spitting out tons of text with the developer not really being able to explain it properly. \n\nPersonally, it takes me longer to develop with AI because it often can't understand what I'm describing and will take the wrong approach if it does, generating logical paradigms that need to be reworked for extensibility. It takes me longer to undo the bad code it creates than it does to just read the documentation and code it from scratch. I've stopped using it completely because it wastes more time than it saves. The SaaS I'm coding is a bit annoying to set up but once I'm done with it, I'll have reusable parts that will snap together into many more SaaS projects.\n\nIn Empire of AI by Karen Hao, who is an engineer who was in school with many folks in the industry, she says that these companies are more in the business of nation building, and that AI is awesome for very specific tasks such as detecting heartbeats, but its not in the AGI realm and is not good at creating general solutions for general problems,  such as code or writing accurate news. \n\nKnowing many folks in tech, large companies thrive off of a combination of real profits and PR that both affect stock price. The current administration is making it difficult for companies to plan for the next four years. Inflation, unpredictable taxes on foreign goods, changing laws around hiring and many other things are making companies very conservative with money.\n\nThis points to a few things IMO: most companies based in the US will (and already are) struggle to compete with international competitors probably decreasing their stock price as soon as there's enough public opinion on this, companies are not freezing hiring because of AI but instead because of unpredictable financial market conditions which can be solved with stable policy choices, AI is an emperors new clothes situation with giant companies sucking up as many resources as they can before people figure out that there's not a serious application for data center powered llms by which time they will own anything they bought with investment money during that time\n\nThis then points to a few things: \nIt's probably not your \"bad prompting,\" AI is really inconsistent, your just getting lucky/unlucky. Companies may be using the excuse of AI to boost stock price when in fact they're really weak and holding on to cash reserves while the economy crashes. The combined lack of growth of US companies + lack of buying power from the average person due to lack of jobs + investment shift to ai preventing growth of new non AI companies + unstable market conditions will probably devastate the US market to a level that hasn't been seen by anyone living currently, many are pointing to the RMB overtaking the USD as the global currency not even due to this but due to the fact that they've invested in their own economy (ai, green technology, manufacturing, construction, transportation, and more) consistently and this is just the death stroke. \n\nMost investors and folks in tech probably know this. It's usually the public who is last to learn after many players like banks and fortune 500s have hedged their bets on the negative future. They all survived the financial crash. It's likely many large financial interests are just quietly moving their focus from companies and currencies that are weak to ones that are strong.\n\nI'm not really sure what the average person can do about global market conditions, but it seems silly to keep using ai for things it doesn't work for. I for one have stopped telling myself that I'm bad at prompting and am just one good prompt away from a million dollar business, when in fact it's faster for me to hand code the exact same business.",

      "selftext": "I have been a frequent user of this subreddit since 2019, and I must say, I am growing weary of the repetitive posts. The constant questions about where to begin and how to build a portfolio are becoming tiresome. I have been in your shoes, and I know how frustrating it can be. So, I want to share some tips to help put an end to this flood of questions.\n\nHere is my action plan for developers who are new to the industry.\n\n1. Check out the [MDN Getting Started Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started). They're a great resource for beginners looking to learn more about the basics of software development and learning about developer soft-skills. \n2. Spend time slowing down, writing things down and speaking out loud with a notebook. \n   * Take the time to slow down, jot things down, and speak out loud with a notebook. It's important to invest in a good pen and notebook to start writing things down immediately. Research has shown that writing things down can improve your attention span and help you retain information in the long run.\n   * Set aside a specific time block for your studying, coding, job hunting, etc. After you finish studying and wrtiing the content inside the notebook, create a new page in your notebook and write a summary of the topic you just learned. Keep this page focused on the topic you researched, and try to keep it to a maximum of one page. Write the summary in your own words to reinforce your understanding.\n   * Once you complete a topic, write a summary on a new page in your notebook. This will serve as your own personal blog. When you're researching and learning new things, avoid relying on tools like ChatGPT or DeepSeek. It's important to challenge yourself to solve problems on your own.\n   * Only type out your notes after the notebook is completed. This way, you can keep track of everything you've learned over time orgnaize things more effectively. By taking the time to write things down and summarize your findings, you'll improve your learning process.\n3. Setting Up Your GitHub\n   * When it comes to setting up your GitHub profile, there really are no right or wrong ways to do it because everyone is unique. However, there are some tips I have learnt overtime.\n   * First, make sure to have a profile picture of yourself and ask someone to write a brief description about you. This personal touch can make your profile more engaging and inviting to others.\n   * Next, treat your GitHub activity like a job by aiming to make a minimum of 10 commits a day. Consistency is key when it comes to showcasing your skills and dedication.\n   * Remember to take a break on Saturdays and Sundays to go out and enjoy life. Having hobbies outside of the computer can help you stay sane during this crazy time.\n   * When making git commits, be sure to write descriptive messages that are easy for others (and your future self) to understand. Clear communication is essential in the world of coding.\n   * If you're unsure about how to use Git with GitHub, consider following **The Odin Project**.\n4. Establishing Your Professional Presence\n   * To begin, craft your resume and cover letter using Google Docs with r/EngineeringResumes wiki template. Familiarize yourself with the [MDN writing guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide) to enhance your technical writing skills. Next, [set up a good LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a554351) and create a Github profile for networking and showcasing your work. More information on how to create these profiles can be found below.\n5. Show employers that you are constantly improving yourself.\n   * Remember those topics you summarized in your notebook? Take some time to review them and jot down new ideas in a developer-like manner. These notes can be used for your future blogs.\n   * If you're unsure how to start writing, find a developer whose style you like and use that and STICK WITH IT. Linux open source enthusiasts are a great source of inspiration, but stay true to yourself.\n   * Don't stress about making mistakes - they just show that you're human and still learning. When proofreading your articles, use AI to help with grammar and flow, but make sure to read them out loud to ensure they sound like you and effectively convey what you've learned.\n6. When is the best time to start building your portfolio? \n   * You should aim to have at least 5 to 10 projects under your belt before showcasing your work. \n   * Consider adding articles from your LinkedIn profile to your portfolio to enhance its content. \n   * Using a template can be a great way to start, as creating one from scratch is time-consuming.\n7. Being social and connecting with others is crucial in today's world.\n   * Spending too much time on the computer can actually be detrimental to your personal and professional growth. Trust me, I've been there. Here are some tips I suggest: \n      * Attend networking events to meet new people and expand your circle.\n      * Take the time to understand corporate culture and dress codes, even if you don't necessarily agree with them. It's all part of the game.\n      * Even if you're not a coding expert, attending coding events can help you learn how to collaborate with other developers.\n      * Show up to in-person events on time and dressed appropriately. First impressions are key and can show potential employers that you're a competent and serious individual.\n      * Don't underestimate the power of fashion and good hygiene. Looking put together can make a big difference in how you're perceived.\n      * Remember, being social and engaging with others can open up new opportunities and help you grow both personally and professionally. So, don't be afraid to step out from behind the computer screen and make those real-life connections.\n8. How can I gain experience buidling website:\n   * If you're looking for some cool projects to work on, I recommend checking out The Odin Project.\n   * Start with their Foundations course, stick with it and complete it. \n   * Move on to their Full Stack Ruby Course if you have no expereince with full stack. \n   * If you have expereince with other backend languages I would look into Full Stack JavaScript.\n9. Stick with one thing by dedicating a set amount of hours at a time and move onto the next one after you’ve reached the limit or completed the work. Do not waist time by juggling task switching. Here’s an example. I will spend a total of 24 hours to research MDN getting started modules. My time limit is 4 hours a day 9am- 12pm and 1hr lunch break and apply to jobs the rest of the day. \n\nI want to clarify that I did not use AI to write this post because I was fed up with all the automated content out there. However I did use it to improve the flow. I also want to point out that this field is extremely competitive, with people from all walks of life.

But \"Seniority\" in 2026 has been downgraded to just memorizing the quirks of ephemeral libraries. If your expertise depends on a framework that didn't exist 5 years ago and won't matter 5 years from now, you aren't a Senior Engineer; you’re a specialized technician for a proprietary product.\n\nThe real \"Senior\" move isn't mastering the next abstraction—it's having the guts to build on the platform itself.

If you already have your own, it is not necessary to acquire them, and if you do acquire them, it is key that they go through a technical, cultural, and psychological interview process, as with any new job.\n\n\\- Always verify all transactions, payments, and customers to ensure they are real.\n\n\\- Paying 100% in advance almost never works out; it is better to keep a percentage to be paid within 6 or 12 months when you see that everything has gone well.\n\n\\- Force the seller to be responsible for the sale (to avoid scams).\n\nThere is much more, but I'm sure this will be useful for your acquisition strategy.\n\nI wrote about this in my book but I don't want to spam so I will not mention it :)",

To cut through the noise, and make things simpler, the r/webhosting mod team **curated** providers we’ve personally used and would confidently use again. This guide covers hosting options that will meet 99% of practical, real-world needs, from small static sites to high-traffic WooCommerce stores. Our picks reflect years of hands-on experience and focus on what actually matters: **performance, helpful support, sane pricing and renewals, reliable backups, platform security, and easy migrations.**\n\n**How we selected providers:**\n\n* **Transparent Pricing:** No hidden fees, clear renewal rates.\n* **Infrastructure:** Modern hardware, sensible replacement cycles, honest resource allocation.\n* **Support Quality:** In-house support, fast average response times, strong technical expertise level, availability of human support.\n* **Platform Openness:** Standard control panels (cPanel, Plesk, etc.), SSH availability, easy in/out migration, no lock-ins\n* **Company Stability:** Long track record in the industry, financial security, proven staying power - we want to recommend hosts that will be around for years to come, not fly-by-night operations\n\n**Real world testing and experience:**\n\nMods have hosted busy sites (typically WordPress) on each of these hosts. We also occasionally secret-shop support with simulated common issues to confirm response times and competence.  These providers also have a representative in the subreddit to help offer guidance when needed.\n\n**Important:** Recommended hosts can help you migrate from a current provider if you're looking for an alternative to your existing host. Most offer free migration services and are excellent alternatives to the high priced and underperforming mega-brands like HostGator, SiteGround, BlueHost, and other brands.\n\n^((As with anything, this list is not set in stone.

All of a sudden I went from 100 page views an hour to 20,000+.  It's been going on for weeks and almost all traffic is from China.  The entire blog is 2.1MB and they downloaded it enough times to use 20+GB of bandwidth before I stopped it.\n\nWhatever the bot is uses Chrome as its user-agent, loads my home page, and all included files (javascript, css, etc).  It also tries to load URLs that are invalid, but look like they could be valid based on my naming scheme - as if they were hallucinated by a poorly-coded AI.\n\nEdit: I just realized the weird URLs are because the bot doesn't respect the base href tag. I will remove that and make all the links absolute. \n\nEdit again: Fixing the URL scheme has reduced the number of hits per hour to between 5,000 and 10,000.\n\nThird edit: Using geographic DNS rules has brought the attack traffic down to &lt;500 hits per hour.\n\nThe stuff I post is about as benign as it gets.  No politics, ethics, social issues, or anything even remotely controversial.  The site is entirely static and the server doesn't even have the capability to run scripts.  If I've pissed someone off, I have no clue whom or why.  Any guesses what the angle is?\n\nI use a CDN so the site is still happily running.  ",

No other datacenter company requires this. \n\nVultr TOS Excerpt:\n\n&gt; information, text, opinions, messages, comments, audio visual works, motion pictures, photographs, animation, videos, graphics, sounds, music, software, Apps, and any other content or material that You or your end users submit, upload, post, host, store, or otherwise make available (“Make Available”) on or through the **Services** (collectively, “Your Content,” “Content” or “User Content”).\n\n&gt; ...\n\n&gt; You hereby grant to Vultr a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, process, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, transmit and distribute each of your User Content, or any portion thereof, in any form, medium or distribution method now known or hereafter existing, known or developed, and otherwise use and **commercialize the User Content in any way that Vultr deems appropriate, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you** or to any third parties, for purposes of providing the Services to you.\n\nThis is NOT standard contract language for web services.  For comparison, Digital Ocean specifically limits this clause to uploads on their website (ie, for community articles, forum posts, etc), not for all hosted services (which would include virtual machines, databases, etc).  Additionally, commercialization rights are not granted and it is not perpetual:\n\nDigital Ocean TOS Excerpt:\n\n&gt; We will periodically differentiate between our websites such as digitalocean.com (which we will refer to collectively as the “Websites”) and all of our other services, such as our cloud infrastructure and other paid services (which we will refer to collectively as the “Services”).\n\n&gt; ...\n\n&gt; By providing your User Content to or via the **Websites**, you grant DigitalOcean a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, and distribute your User Content, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels.\n\nThough requesting limited permissions for the purposes of user uploads on a forum or other community site is fairly standard, it is not reasonable for a service provider partner to require full, irrevocable commercial rights of anything hosted on their services.  That'd let Vultr take and monetize customer databases, apps, software, etc. which almost every business would likely find objectionable.  Vultr needs to restrict their request as is done elsewhere in the industry.\n\nI mailed Vultr about it, but I'm most likely indefinitely locked out of my account until I fork over rights to my business to them.  Not that I think they particularly care to resell my apps/sites/end user data (egad, what are even the end user PII ramifications of that), but it's the principle of the matter.  I've generally otherwise been a happy customer, spending a couple thousand a year with them and recommending them to others -- but I think it's healthy to push back on overly broad contracts and let big companies know when they overstep.",

Today:\n\n* 401k: $58,341.23\n* Emergency Fund: $26,784.52\n* Daughter's 529: $12,453.89\n* Investments: $2,892.31\n* Total: $100,471.95\n\nNothing crazy compared to most posts here, but for a single dad making $65k in retail management, this feels huge. The journey:\n\n2020: Rock bottom after divorce. -$32k net worth (credit cards and car loan), living in a 1-bedroom apartment with my daughter sleeping in the bedroom while I took the couch.\n\nWhat worked:\n\n* Every tax return and stimulus check went to debt\n* Promoted twice (45k → 55k → 65k)\n* Found remote work = no more daycare costs\n* Meal prep Sundays with daughter (she loves \"helping\")\n* Automated savings the day paychecks hit\n* Daughter's mom started helping with expenses\n\nNot posting this to brag - honestly still paycheck to paycheck some months. But man, seeing that number hit six figures while my daughter sleeps soundly in her own room... worth every budget dinner and missed night out.\n\nNext goal: Building her college fund and maybe a house down payment.

Why focus on all these useless tools that I cannot give my learners? \n\nI just want to go back to actual tools I could put in my kid's hands again to engage them in new ways instead of another 8 PDs all about how I as a teacher could us AI. \n\n  \nDoes anyone else see this happening in their districts too?

We do not receive significant public or private funding, but we’ve managed to get by. We made the move to 1:1 several years ago but Covid saw an explosion of new edtech on the market making use of all the federal funding. I think that’s really where the problem started. Since Covid-times, subscription costs are going through the roof and apps we’ve used for years we are now having to drop because we simply can’t afford them. I’m not talking about 3-5% annual YoY increases (which I actually expect), I’m talking about 3x the cost increases. When pressing vendors they’re saying “new features” are the cause, but we didn’t ask for them. Instead of gating the new features behind paywalls, they just force everyone to pay to adopt them. Our only recourse has been to not renew - but then the students and teachers suffer. \n\nProbably screaming into the void, but is everyone seeing these massive increases? Are vendors even listening and/or in tune to the financial state of public schools in this country?",

I'm currently working sales, which in itself is exhausting work, but I think I'm also just worn out by the company culture that can be ubiquitous in this industry. We're all just SO HAPPY to be doing such MEANINGFUL WORK each day, you know? But behind the scenes, everyone is working way more than 40 hours per week and it's for much less than you'd be making outside of the education world. However, there are so many people desperate to get out of teaching that they know they could replace you in seconds, so you just suck it up and accept the pennies they're offering. Meanwhile Marketing is angry with us because we're not liking and sharing their social media posts enough via our private accounts, and the Recruitment team is demanding that each and every one of us review the company positively on GlassDoor \\*right.now\\*. Yeah... we're so happy! \n\nAnyway, things are coming to a head and I feel like my years of customer service and sales work are coming to an end and I just want a job with no human interaction. I just want 8 hours of work in front of me each morning, and I just want people to leave me alone while I do it. Maybe it's also the company retreat coming up where last year we had a citywide scavenger hunt. (mandatory fun) Guys, I'm 50, not 20. My knees hurt and I'm tired. \n\nCan anyone relate? Does anyone have an exit plan for themselves? I've been looking around, and although I have like 30 years of experience, it seems like the job that I would want would mean I'd be making maybe $20 an hour if that. Is that my fate? Is there anything else? I'm too young to retire, but god I don't know if I can handle anything related to anything that I've been doing these past three decades any longer. ",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI'm a retired portfolio manager at a mutual fund (think Vanguard/Fidelity) and wanted to open up an AMA for anyone on this thread if I can be helpful. I’ve been retired for a few years now, and in that time I’ve seen both the markets and the way people invest change more than I ever imagined.\n\nBut before talking about what’s new, let’s start with the constants — the mistakes that trip up both professionals and retail investors.\n\n# The Biggest Mistakes I Saw (and Made) Over My Career\n\n1. **Chasing performance** — buying last quarter’s or last year’s winners without understanding *why* they ran.\n2. **Falling in love with a position** — getting attached to the story and ignoring the math of diversification.\n3. **No sell plan** — knowing when to enter but never defining the exit.\n4. **Letting dead money sit** — holding losers for years because you can’t admit the thesis is broken.\n\nThese are timeless — I saw $50k retail accounts and $5B funds make the exact same errors. The dollar amounts change, but the psychology is the same.\n\n# A Path to Investing Your Own Savings\n\nIf you’re managing your own money today, you have an advantage I didn’t see in my early career: you can build an institutional-quality process without working at an institution.\n\nStart by writing down your **investment philosophy** — what you believe about the market, risk, and opportunity. Then define **position sizing rules** (how much to put into each trade), **risk limits** (max drawdowns you’ll accept), and **sell discipline** (when to cut or take profit).\n\nYou don’t need 50 positions. You need enough diversification to survive bad luck, and enough conviction to let your winners matter. Review your portfolio monthly, not hourly. The point is to compound — not to get every single trade right.\n\n# Tools Worth Using Today\n\nBack when I started, if you didn’t have a Bloomberg Terminal and a $20k+ research budget, you were behind. Now the playing field is flatter — retail investors have access to:\n\n* **Koyfin** — macro dashboards, asset correlations, and real-time economic tracking. [koyfin.com](http://koyfin.com)\n* **Robinhood** — commission-free trades, fractional shares, and easier scaling for smaller accounts. [robinhood.com](http://robinhood.com)\n* **Oracle** — built by ex-hedge fund analysts, delivers institutional-grade trade ideas in a retail-friendly format. [oraclewlth.com](http://oraclewlth.com)\n* **AI &amp; scripting tools** — pull, clean, and analyze datasets in minutes that used to take analyst teams days. alpaca is one of these but also recommend openbb.\n\nI’m happy to answer questions about position sizing, building a process, using these tools together, or stories from the fund world.\n\n**Ask me anything.**",

      "selftext": " I'm an adult content affiliate, out of all the niches I've tried this one has by far been the easiest and quickest to scale. Now my tips will apply to anyone who's in affiliate marketing no matter what niche. \n\nTip 1 - Choose a good &amp; trusted affiliate company to promote. There's many out there, take your time and research each companies reviews before choosing one to join. \n\nTip 2 - Promote the offers you have correctly. By far, I make my most money off Revshare offers. This is my bread and butter because I collect a percentage of everything my traffic spends for life. Whether they purchase a product, buy a membership, or purchase tokens to tip the cam models they enjoy watching. Ill collect a percentage of that for life. \n\nHowever if you're just starting out and don't have social pages that push in a lot of traffic then you should look to start out promoting PPL (pay per lead) affiliate offers. These offers payout smaller amounts however it's much easier to earn from because your traffic doesn't have to spend a penny. \n\nThere's two types of PPL offers which are SOI &amp; DOI. \nSingle Opt In &amp; Double Opt In. SOI payouts are a little smaller than DOI but they're easier to get. Whenever your traffic clicks your offer and creates an account on the platform you're promoting all they have to do is confirm their email OR phone number for you to get paid. Simple and easy to get. For DOI offers your traffic would need to confirm their email + their phone number in order for you to get paid. \n\nOvertime as you build your traffic sources you'll want to start implementing revshare lifetime offers so that you can start building your passive income portfolio. \n\nTip 3 - This is the most important one that surprisingly a lot of people struggle with. If you want to be successful then you HAVE to be consistent with posting to your social accounts so that your traffic sources are continuously building. \n\nIf you can follow that strategy and of course implement your own then I promise you'll make a living in affiliate marketing no matter what niche you're in 🤙 If you read this far and find this knowledge useful consider letting me know. I'm happy to help others, and while I'm not a professional insanely rich influencer, I have found my niche and I'm making more money online then any 9-5 job I've ever worked. So hopefully my experience can help someone else! ",

It takes real work before anything “hands-off” happens.\n\n**2. “Shiny object syndrome will wreck you.”**\n\nThere’s always a new product, a new course, a new “secret method.” Chasing everything burns time and money. Pick one good system and go deep.\n\n**3. “You don’t have to be a tech wizard.”**\n\nI thought I needed crazy tech skills. Truth is, beginner-friendly tools exist now (like drag-and-drop page builders) that make it way easier than it used to be.\n\n**4. “Mindset matters way more than tactics.”**\n\nWhen you’re older, doubt creeps in hard: “Am I too late?” “Am I too old for this?” Trust me, it’s never too late if you’re consistent. Most people quit just before it clicks.\n\n**5. “Help people first, and the money follows.”**\n\nPeople can smell desperation from a mile away.

I even dumped $7k into video editing last year and saw almost no returns (yet) on that investment because they just don't convert. Idk, maybe great edits lower trust, but this is encouraging if you don't have much to start with.\n* LinkedIn SEO — so you know how reddit shows up for so many things on google? Well guess what, LinkedIn does too. This has been my secret weapon for about 2 years now. It's honestly going down, but if you want to squeeze some life out of it - all I did was write my review content on LinkedIn. I kept it shorter than a typical blog post (\\~300 words) and didn't include images or anything. But my posts ranked HIGH. A single post form 2022 has cleared me about $200/mo on autopilot. I'm obviously not going to share what I reviewed because it's still paying me free money haha.\n* High ticket sticky products — I hate even using that word high-ticket because it's been associated with such scammers, but the truth is products like the Kajabi ($2000/yr software) is extremely sticky. Once someone buys it, they stay on for years (which is why that alone has been awesome). I will say, there are some services that work the same way (usually agency focused) where you can get a cut of big spend for months, and sometimes years. The only ones I've made work were from irl relationships though, so I can't tell you exactly how to replicate. Just know, 1 big sale makes up for hundreds of smaller ones.\n   * Here is the exact campaign that's earned the $ in the screenshot  https:// app. kajabi. com/ r / vJSjoiwz/t/dyrmjuw3\n\nWHAT HASN'T WORKED:\n\n* TikTok or IG — I don't spend much time on those platforms, so I probably just never learned how to make them work, but even the shorts I recorded would perform better on YouTube (click wise, not view count wise).\n* Traditional blogging — now, I will still get amazon assoc. money from blogs (maybe $10-40/day), but ALL of that is from articles that are 2-3+ years old. Nothing I've publishing recently has gotten me anything. Idk, blame AI or saturation, but it feels like that part of the funnel is dead for now.\n\nWHY BOTHER SHARING:\n\n* I physically hate bad/outdated advice. Obv it's a waste of time to get mad at the internet haha, but seriously, so much of the \"tried and true\" stuff just doesn't work anymore. It's a waste of time and money. And people actually need good affiliate stuff (when I had a content agency, I desperately wanted trustworthy people talking about my stuff and was happy to pay them 30%, but man is that hard to find).\n* Product sales &gt; affiliate marketing. Yep, I don't know (personally) any good affiliate marketers who didn't end up going all in on their own product or service eventually. The better you get at promoting something, the more it makes sense to put that effort towards your own stuff. That's not to say don't do am, just know that once you get really good - you're probably going to want to shift.\n* Talk about fewer products (I was going to include a \"what I would do differently\" section, but this was the only point that really mattered). 80% of my aff income has come from 5 products. The caveat is that I talked about them A LOT. Online and in person. They were actually good, and they actually made sense to recommend to my network (other writers, content folks, etc.). Look for the low-hanging fruit in your own life - and then stick to it.\n\nWrote this while I'm waiting for an oil change. Feel free to ask questions if there are any, but if you're just going to be mean or unhelpful, keep that to yourself. ✌️",

      "selftext": "I've been in the affiliate marketing game for about a year now, driven by the dream of ditching my soul-sucking 9-to-5. After experimenting with a ton of programs, I've finally honed in on three that are consistently delivering results. Here's the scoop:  \n  \n1. **Personal Finance App**: This one's a gem, bringing in around $4k monthly with a sweet 30% recurring commission. It's a breeze to promote, especially with the growing interest in financial literacy. I focus on platforms like Instagram and YouTube, sharing tips on budgeting and saving, and subtly weaving in the app as a must-have tool.  \n  \n2. **Digital Course Platform**: Earning me about $2.5k monthly with a 40% commission, this platform is a hit among aspiring entrepreneurs and lifelong learners. I create content around skill-building and career advancement on LinkedIn and TikTok, positioning the platform as the go-to resource for upskilling.  \n  \n3. **Niche Software Tool**: This one's pulling in $2.8k monthly with a hefty one-time payout. It's a bit more niche, but the high payout makes it worth it. I target specific forums and subreddits where enthusiasts hang out, offering genuine advice and slipping in the tool as a game-changer.  \n  \nFocusing on these three has really streamlined my strategy and boosted my income. If you're feeling overwhelmed by too many programs, maybe try narrowing down to a few that align with your interests and audience. Happy marketing!",

Here's a list of my screwups, hope it helps someone.\n\n* I was obsessed with keywords and my posts sounded like a damn robot. I was writing for google, not for an actual person. No personlity at all, just dry info.\n* My traffic stratgy was literally just 'post and pray'. I thought SEO was some kind of magic and didnt bother trying to promote my articles anywhere else. No pinterest, no forums, nothing.\n* I promoted products I'd never actually touched. I was basically just rewriting amazon reviews and trying to pass it off as a real opinion. People can smell that fakeness from a mile away.\n* I got impatient and quit way too early. This is the one that really gets me. Looking back at the analytics, the traffic was *just* starting to slowly tick up. I was probably a few months away from things actually working, but I got discouraged cause I wasnt rich yet.\n\nAnyway, my new site is doing a lot better cause im avoiding all that. Its slow, but its real progress.\n\nHope this helps someone else not make the same dumb mistakes I did.\n\n**TL;DR:** My first site failed cause I wrote like a robot, had no traffic plan besides praying to google, promoted stuff I never used, and quit right before it probably would have worked.

Sometimes 1, sometimes none.\n\nThe pay out for every 1,000 views in the finance niche can vary; it can be as low as 2-4 dollars for \"broad\" videos like \"how to get out of debt\" and it can go as high as over 100 USD for super targeted videos. Of course, it's never constant. It always varies (which is the down side of relying on ad sense).\n\nThe split has been around 50/50 between affiliates and ad sense.\n\nMy videos don't go viral, they get about 10-20K views over time.\n\nOne video made over $1100 just on Ad revenue (with about 20K views).\n\nWhen it comes to affiliates, you really have to hunt them. Impact is a good source for many products and services you can promote, you just have to make sure they align with the channel, so you can build credibility and trust, and make them valuable to people, so users are encouraged to use your links.\n\nOne key lesson I've learned is the more helpful and valuable your video is, the more likely viewers will be to use your links.\n\nLet know what questions you have with respect to affiliates, YouTube, etc.\n\nOpen to questions.\n\n  \n(PS: I figured I shared this here in this community as well)",

      "selftext": "Ive been doing affiliate marketing for about 18 months mostly through SEO and its been slow going, couple hundred bucks a month max. I decided to test pinterest hard starting in july because I needed to diversify traffic sources\n\n**Niche:** Home &amp; kitchen products (amazon associates mainly)\n\n**Strategy:** I created a pinterest business account and started posting product roundup pins (best coffee makers, best kitchen gadgets under $50 etc) Im using tailwind to schedule 12 pins per day consistently because manual posting was impossible to maintain. I joined 12 communities in the home/kitchen niche through tailwind which amplified reach significantly.\n\n**Results timeline:** month 1: $143 in commissions (almost quit here lol), month 2: $387 in commissions, month 3: $1,240 in commissions, month 4: $2,100 in commissions\n\nTraffic went from 340 pinterest visitors in july to 4,800+ in october and the click-through rate to Amazon is consistently 2.8-3.2% which is way higher than my SEO traffic.\n\n**Key factors:**  with tailwinds smartpin feature I create 5-6 variations of each pin design quickly instead of spending an hour per pin in canva. The scheduling keeps me consistent even when I'm busy with other projects. Communities exposed my pins to thousands more people without spending on ads. Ghostwriter ai writes decent pin descriptions that are SEO-optimized which saves time\n\n**Metrics that matter:** monthly impressions: 890k in october, pin saves: 2,400+, monthly CTR to my site: 1.8%, amazon CTR from site: around 3%\n\nBiggest lesson is pinterest takes 6-8 weeks to gain traction so you cant judge results in the first month. Also product comparison pins (X vs Y) outperform generic roundup pins significantly. Vertical format 1000x1500 crushes square formats.\n\nFor affiliate marketers I'd say pinterest is seriously underrated compared to SEO right now.",

      "selftext": "Hello, everyone. A couple of days ago, I made this post, and it seemed to help and inspire a lot of people, and I got a ton of DMs, questions, which is good. I enjoy helping people and I got to as many questions as i could.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/1h79yh9/made\\_25k\\_with\\_youtube\\_and\\_affiliate\\_marketing/?utm\\_source=share&amp;utm\\_medium=web3x&amp;utm\\_name=web3xcss&amp;utm\\_term=1&amp;utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/1h79yh9/made_25k_with_youtube_and_affiliate_marketing/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\nOne of the most common questions my DMs were about is how to choose a niche on YouTube since everything seems to be crowded.\n\nSo I wanted to share how I personally picked my niche, and make it simple and straight to the point, so those who are just getting started and need clarity can benefit.\n\nI've been doing YouTube over the last 4 years, but I started taking it seriously (being intentional) over the last year and a half.\n\nWhen I was re-calibrating my YouTube strategy, I started doing more research on what viewers wanted.\n\nI ran into a video of a product in the personal finance niche, which I had used myself and had good experience.\n\nWhen I watched the video, I noticed a couple of things:\n\n1. The channel had about 20K subscribers\n2. The video about the product review had about 50K views\n\nNow, after a lot of lessons learned on YouTube, and also after taking a whole YouTube course, I learned that if a video has a lot more views than a channel has subscribers over the last year, it means there is a lot of demand for such video.\n\nFor example, if a video has 100K views, and the channel has 10K subscribers, AND it was posted over the last couple of months, the probability of success are VERY high.\n\nI can almost guarantee it.\n\nThat's been my experience with many of the videos I made (In fact, this is a strategy that helped me monetize a \"viral\" entertainment channel in only two weeks (got 10. This is a side project. It's a faceless channel.).\n\nAnyway, I decided to make the same video, reviewing the same product, with my own spin.\n\nI was genuine about it, sharing what I thought, and the video had the following structure:\n\n1. My quick story using the product (1 minute to 2 minutes max)\n2. Then I went over the current best features\n3. Then over the pros, cons  of the product\n4. Overall recommendation (who's it for?)\n5. Call to action letting people know I had a link in the description they could use to sign up.\n\nThat was it.\n\nNot surprisingly, that video did very well, and I maxed out all of my affiliates eventually (for those who don't know, many products in the personal finance niche have a ceiling and you have a limit on how much you can earn. They do this so they prevent people from engaging in \"illicit  activities.\" That's what I found.)\n\nAnyway, my experience right here gave me the idea to go down even deeper into this product and its industry.\n\nI started making more reviews about it, answering frequently asked questions in the videos, and comparing it to other competitors.\n\nI signed up for more of the competitors for research purposes, and I started expanding the affiliates I got.\n\nI didn't always get approved, and some of the products I signed up for did not have affiliates, but I had enough to start making decent money.\n\nMy best day, I made about 500 USD in one day.\n\nI won't lie, there are some videos I made that flopped, that didn't get many views, but others that did.\n\nIf there is one thing I learned from Jeff Bezos is this:\n\nIn business, you will have many failures. But then you will have one or two products that succeed, and they will make up and pay for all the failures and even more.\n\nI try to keep this in mind when I am making YouTube videos.\n\nI'm sure you've noticed this as well in some capacity. If you go to any YouTube channel, you'll see not every video has the same performance. There will always be outliers. Even for Mr. Beast.\n\nAnyway, how can you choose your niche? Why am I sharing all of this?\n\nHere's a few pointers for you:\n\n1. Learn into your experience (even if it's a \"saturated\" niche): What's a product you used, that you have experience with? Even if it's investing, just talk about it. Once you talk about that one product, you can expand and talk about its competitors. This is what I did. I used X product, then I compared it to Y. Then I reviewed Y product by itself. It's just a matter of arranging your cards to win.\n2. Expand and experiment: If you've had experience with multiple products, talk about them all. Do keyword research to see what people are watching, what is trending.\n3. Don't be afraid to sign up for programs, buy the product if it's physical. You can always buy it, review it, and then return it. Look into what other people are saying online, and then add that to your video with screenshots.\n4. Keep it simple: If you are doing beyond your comfort zone, going to talk about a product that you have no clue about only because it may make money, I guarantee you will burn out. This is what I experienced too. I was talking so much about one product that I got sick of it. haha, so don't be afraid to expand and explore other similar/parallel products. It's good to start specific, then slowly vary the content and reviews.\n\nOnce you choose your niche, here are a few other pointers to successfully do affiliate marketing on YouTube:\n\na) Quality matters: If affiliate marketing is your main thing on YouTube, focus on providing the most value to your customers. That is, doing research, answering questions people have in comments in forums, essentially sharing insight that your viewers can't just find by going to the website of the product. I personally like to share \"FAQs\" with every video. Not only does it increase YouTube watch time (which means more ad money and good for the channel), it also adds more credibility and trust (more money).\n\nb) Camera presence on YouTube is huge: In 2024, if you are talking to a professional audience, if you are educating, or sharing a review of a product, you need a good background, a good mic, and good camera presence. You don't have to be the world's best speaker, but you do have to be professional. This doesn't mean be fake, this just means being yourself, but still professional.\n\nc) Some tools I use to make my YouTube videos:\n\ni. I use my phone to record, on a tripod.\n\nii. Green screen (30 USD). If you don't have a \"nice\" background, you can get a green screen and then just slap a nice background on it. A lot of big YouTubers do this. Better than a  white wall. Viewers judge the background more than you think. It's OK to start modest, but eventually, gotta improve.\n\niii. Mic. I use the Yetti, record it, then use adobe podcast to improve the audio. It makes my 100 USD mic sound like the SHURE, which costs like 300 USD. Be resourceful and work with what you have\n\niv. Canva for thumbnails (free version)\n\nv. Perplexity for research (free version) and ChatGpt for script writing sometimes (paid version).\n\nThat's pretty much all for now.\n\nHope it helps.",

Took some testing, but it worked out.\n\nHere’s how it went down.I used paid Facebook ads—Facebook, Instagram, all their placements about $132k total.\n\nThat got me 2,532 leads at $150 each and 255 calls worth $31,340.\n\nRevenue hit $293k, though some leads went unpaid if they’d been submitted by another publisher in the last 30-60 days.\n\nSold everything to an aggregator, not direct to lawyers.\n\nThe big shift was going Spanish instead of English.\n\nEnglish market’s crowded—everyone’s doing it. Spanish had less competition, cheaper ads, better conversion rates. Cost per lead dropped from $70 to around $50, and the leads were solid, closing more deals.\n\nMade a real difference.\n\nWhat worked? Manual bidding and AI UGC ads\n\nManual bidding kept my costs steady—no surprises. AI for user-generated content cut ad production costs from $150 a pop to $15, and production went from days to maybe an hour with edits.\n\nLead quality and CPL stayed the same as human-made ads. I’ve been playing with AI for like 10 years, so it was an easy call.\n\nSetup was simple: targeted Spanish speakers on Facebook, ran Spanish UGC ads, built a Spanish landing page.\n\nConversion rates went up, costs went down. If I had one tip, it’d be this: look at less competitive markets. Switching languages can flip your costs if you’re smart about it. Test manual bids too—saves you cash.\n\nThat’s it. Questions, let me know. (edited for clarity on ad spend)",

      "selftext": "Hello (*this detailed case study is for those who want to have the precise numbers, costing and details of processes so they can build a content site that is monetised through affiliate marketing like Amazon and display ads like Ezoic)*\n\n**BASIC IDEA:** Before I share hard data with complete process how to achieve this. Let me share the basic idea.\n\n* Create a **content site with automated AI content** (cheap as compared to human writers, costs shared in this case study)\n* Build backlinks (details shared later in this case study with process)\n* Once it ranks and gets traffic from Google, **make money (minimal or management) with ads and affiliate marketing** (just like a rental property makes money while you sleep). $3,674/m in this case in 14 months.\n* **Sell the website** like you could sell your rental property\n\nIn this case study, we grew a site from **$0 to $3,674/m in 14 months (done cheaper, faster and in a more scalable way using automated AI content that beats Google updates)**\n\n**This is an AMA so feel free to ask questions.**\n\nInitially, the cost of building/acquiring, growing, managing/selling these affiliate sites used to be higher. However, with AI the costs have gone considerably down.\n\nIn comparison...\n\n* Old cost: $65,000 for 500,000 words\n* New cost: $5000 for 1,500,000 (words) 3 times number of words for 7.7% of the cost\n\nBased on this...\n\nWe have made a very IMPORTANT transition that has helped us maintain a **portfolio of 41+ websites with 5M+ organic hits per month**...\n\nContent production has moved from human written content to human assisted AI and now fully automated AI content. Becoming AI's ally was important otherwise, it had killed the content business.\n\n**MAIN IDEA:** Bulk publish easy to rank info articles that follow the same structure. Do this by AI for content and scripting for automation. Additionally, build links if you have fresh domain.\n\n**SITE RESULTS (Before and After)**\n\n|Parameter|1st Month (March 2023)|14th Month (April 2024)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|DR (power of the site)|0|34|\n|Articles/posts|0|1023|\n|Referring Domains|0|179 (we built 75 of these, rest are natural)|\n|Traffic per month|0|216,058|\n|RPM (revenue/1000 visits)|0|$17|\n|Revenue/m|0|$3,674|\n|CRO|No|Yes|\n\n**Month on Month Growth (Traffic and Revenue)**\n\n|Month|Traffic|Revenue|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|March 2023|0|0|\n|April 2023|0|0|\n|May 2023|0|0|\n|June 2023|0|0|\n|July 2023|13|0|\n|Aug 2023|41|$3.17|\n|Sept. 2023|56|$0.98|\n|Oct. 2023|39|$2.73|\n|Nov. 2023|962|$13.21|\n|Dec. 2023|5,197|$89.43|\n|Jan. 2024|37,571|$410.17|\n|Feb. 2024|183,251|$1,619|\n|Mar. 2024|193,447|$3,916|\n|April 2024|216,058|$3,674|\n|Total|636,635|$9,728.69|\n\n**SITE SUMMARY**\n\n* Niche: Home Improvement\n* Domain: Fresh\n* TLD: .com\n\nBefore, I expand on this and share the **exact process, numbers and growth** so you can implement the same principles on your project as well...\n\n**Previous case studies (you can check my profile to read these in detail)**\n\n* [\\[CASE STUDY Manual AI Site\\] From 217/m to $2,836/m in 9 months - Sold for $59,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/16gqwk2/case_study_passive_income_ai_content_site_from/)\n* [Amazon Affiliate Content Site: $371/m to $19,263/m in 14 MONTHS - $900K CASE STUDY \\[AMA\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/xdafzy/amazon_affiliate_content_site_371m_to_19263m_in/)\n* [Affiliate Website from $267/m to $21,853/m in 19 months (CASE STUDY - Amazon?) \\[AMA\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/ll2w22/affiliate_website_from_267m_to_21853m_in_19/)\n* [Amazon Affiliate Website from $0 to $7,786/month in 11 months](https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/ahvuq6/amazon_affiliate_website_from_0_to_7786month_in/)\n* [Amazon Affiliate Site from $118/m to $3,103/m in 8 MONTHS (SOLD it for $62,000+)](https://www.reddit.com/r/juststart/comments/fw8pxs/amazon_affiliate_site_from_118m_to_3103m_in_8/)\n\n**In this case study, I will explain...**\n\n* Overview of results (shared above)\n* Month on month growth (shared above)\n* Affiliate site summary (shared above)\n* What's the main idea (explained in detail)\n* How to do it?\n* Researching niche\n* Devising a content plan (article topics with main and secondary keywords, categories, subcategories and more)\n* Reverse engineering competitors for an article structure that ranks\n* Creating prompts that the script would run to create posts in bulk\n* Bulk uploading the articles on WordPress\n* Submitting and Indexing\n* Building Backlinks\n* Conversion rate optimisation\n* Costing (very important)\n\n**MAIN IDEA**\n\nThe idea is to:\n\n* Find a niche with enough search volume and easy to beat competition\n* Find content topics that can be answered using a similar article structure\n* Example of similar structure article topics: What does \"sun\" mean in \"tarot\", What does \"emperor\" mean in \"tarot\"\n* In the above example, the queries have the same format: What does X mean in Y (use Ahrefs SEO tool)\n* Benefit: This helps us craft an article structure that can be replicated over thousands of articles\n* Then, devise the article structure by reverse engineering the competitors\n* Article structure will consist of different sections\n* Construct AI prompts for each section to produce content. We used ChatGPT\n* Use Open AI and scripts to generate content for each section. Here, you will take input from the excel sheet that consists of the these keywords and related keywords\n* Generate CSV that has all the responses\n* Use WP ALL IMPORT to publish on WordPress Site\n\n**HOW TO DO IT?**\n\nExecuting this is reliant on three main variables. If you get these three right, the odds of success for such a project get higher.\n\n* Content Plan (like a blueprint of a rental property)\n* Content production (construction of a rental property)\n* Backlinks (marketing the rental property so people come see it as traffic and then rent it as conversions)\n\n**1. Content Plan**\n\nThis is like a blueprint for the whole project. One of the redditors commented on my previous case studies and summarised it perfectly. He said, it's like a map to a treasure while you're sailing on the ship. If this blueprint is right and you follow the directions (execute), you will get the treasure. Otherwise, you will waste your time, resources and skills chasing something you'll never get. After years of efforts your ship will sink. This is very well put. I would like to thank him for this.\n\nImportant elements of content plan are:\n\n* Niche selection: The criteria is:\n   * Enough total search volume\n   * Beatable competition\n   * Display ads allow that niche\n   * Enough affiliate programs\n   * Enough small sites to ensure that you can still make money at a small scale\n   * Enough big sites to ensure that you can make money at a big scale as well (this applies only when you wish to keep the project for long term and not sell when it's still small i.e. making less than $10,000 a month)\n* Identifying queries with similar article structure (tarot example shared in the main idea section)\n* Extracting queries in CSV\n* Manually clustering the similar ones together. Example: \"what does SUN mean in tarot\" and \"what do you mean by SUN in tarot\" are essentially the same\n* Finalising the articles based on above clustering and removing irrelevant ones\n* Categorising into categories/subcategories\n* Finalising pages (affiliates disclaimer, privacy policy, about us, contact, homepage content)\n\n**2. Content Production**\n\nYou need articles on the site that target keywords that people are searching on Google. The research for those keywords was done in the previous step. This step explains how to write articles for those keywords so you can get traffic.\n\n* Reverse engineering competitors: analysing how the top ranking competitors are answering those queries in the form of articles\n* Analysing the structure: What's their intro like, what's the first section then the next and next\n* Compile this info to construct an article structure that covers everything and can be implemented to all the article topics (this is why we chose the topics that could be answered with the same article structure and are not too different)\n* Include semantically relevant entities (engineer prompt accordingly)\n* Ensure relevance to the main and subcategory and other articles within the same categories/subcategories\n\n**3. Backlinks**\n\nNow that you have articles written in step 2 content production, you need to market them. You reach out to other relevant/general websites that can write about similar topics as your website and add a link pointing to your site in their post. This is called a backlink.\n\nHere's a quick tip: Reach out to prospects and clearly ask if they offer a sponsored post. It makes things much easier and saves time.\n\nHere's the criteria for the backlinks:\n\n* Niche relevant or general sites\n* DR greater than 15 (Ahrefs)\n* Search traffic greater than 250 (Ahrefs)\n* Content based\n* Dofollow\n* Indexed\n* Anchor text that is relevant\n* Permanent\n\n**Generating Prompts and Scripting for Bulk Content Production**\n\nThis step explains how to generate content with ChatGPT so you can generate content that ranks. Remember, there is no use to target topics or produce content that is NOT going to get traffic.\n\nThe prompt engineering is highly dependent on what the competitors are doing. You have to analyse things like tone, structure, flow of sentences, paragraphs and general outline of the article. Devise prompts for each section and compare it with the competitors to get something as close BUT BETTER than that. Remember that in order to rank, you can be different in a way that it's better than the competitors. However, do NOT be too different. Otherwise, you won't rank.\n\nAs far as the script is concerned, it would be hard to explain it here. But, imagine...\n\n* Excel sheet\n* Column 1: Main keywords\n* Column 2: Secondary keywords\n* Column 3: Section 1 of article e.g. intro (generated based on a unique prompt to this that takes input from column 1 and 2)\n* Column 4:  Section 2 of article e.g. first heading (generated based on a unique prompt to this that takes input from column 1 and 2)\n* So and so forth to finish all sections of the article\n\nThis excel sheet is connected with OpenAI's API and the formula is added to each cell, it interacts with the API and sends request to produce the content using prompt coded into that formula and input taken from column 1 and 2.\n\nResult: A CSV that consists of thousands of rows, each representing one article. Each row consisting of multiple columns. Each column representing a section of that article.\n\n**Bulk Content Publishing on WordPress**\n\nNow, you will have 1000s of articles. You can't manually upload them to WordPress. It would take a lot of time. This step explains how to do it in a matter of seconds in an automated way.\n\nUsing the CSV in the above step, you can use WP All import (WordPress plugin) to bulk publish the posts.\n\nIt would be redundant to explain the process here as you can easily check out a simple explainer YouTube video on this.\n\n**Submitting and Indexing**\n\nOnce you publish the content, Google needs to know that it exists. Otherwise, how will it rank, right?\n\nThis step explains how to submit and index.\n\nUse Google Developers API and RankMath to index the generated posts. Again, a simple Google search can return a guide that can help you do this. Writing this here is inefficient.\n\n**Conversion Rate Optimisation**\n\nIn this step, you optimise your content and page in a way so people click the maximum number of ads and affiliate offers so you can make more money.\n\nThe conversion rate optimisation of this project was done somewhere in around 12th month onwards. The RPM in previous recent months was around $10. But, with this CRO it increased to $17.\n\nWe did the following:\n\n* Ads and affiliate offers in the sidebar\n* Call to action for relevant affiliate offers in the form of a beautiful table right after the intro section\n\n**Costing**\n\n*Expenses*\n\n* Content: Almost 1,500,000 words\n* Content cost: $7500 (includes API tokens, researching comp., devising structure, prompts, publishing, everything etc.)\n* Backlinks that we built and paid for: 75\n* Average cost per backlink: $110\n* Total cost for backlinks: $8,250\n* Other admin: $1000\n* Total: $7,500 + $8,250 + $1000 = $16,750\n\n*Return*\n\n* Earnings (affiliate and display): $9,728.69\n* Sold: $108,000 (private sale)\n* Total: $117,728.69\n\n*Net*\n\n* Net: $117,728.69 - $16,750 = $100,978.69\n* ROI: 602%\n* Duration: 14 months\n\n**Way Forward and Analysis**\n\nThe fundamental shift in our approach was necessary. Producing content for brands and affiliate sites got super expensive and unable to rank with human writers. It killed a lot of big SEO projects in the industry.\n\nThe pivot enabled us to produce content faster, cheaper and in a more scalable way with higher quality.\n\nWith this approach, the goal is to scale the portfolio even further and hopefully publish more case studies of exits.\n\nIf you have any feedback/questions - feel free to let me know. This is an AMA. I would be happy to answer.\n\nCheers and I wish you best of luck to build your own affiliate website for passive income.",

      "selftext": "I see so many posts from people wanting to start, but are getting overwhelmed and frustrated. Affiliate marketing is a simple concept and you can break it down into a couple of easy steps to become successful.\n\nMost people should be able to follow these steps, but the key is to actually make plan, write down your goals, break them up into actionable tasks, start executing and holding yourself accountable.\n\nNow, there's basically two ways to make money in the affiliate game:\n\n1. Send organic traffic to affiliate offers\n2. Send paid traffic to affiliate offers\n\n**For organic traffic this would be your simple game plan:**\n\n1. Pick an evergreen market and a niche within that market.\n2. Setup a website (I use [Systeme](https://gosysteme.com) it's free).\n3. Create awesome content around the big issues in your niche, solving the problems of your target audience and answering their questions (keyword research).\n4. Add affiliate links to offers relevant to your content.\n5. Repurpose your content in YouTube videos. tiktoks, Pinterest, etc.\n6. Promote your content. Link to your website and videos, never direct link to the offer.\n7. Invest your money into content outsourcing and ads, to grow quicker and scale your business.\n\nYou can find free YouTube tutorials on all of these steps. No need to buy courses from guru's.\n\nAgain, this looks easy but will take a lot of work! And you'll need patience. To get traction with organic traffic takes months.\n\nWrite down where you want to be a year from now. Then make a plan to get to that goal (use the steps above). Split them up in actionable tasks and make monthly, weekly and daily planning, set targets. I use [Notion](https://notion.so) for this.\n\nStick to your planning and reward yourself after completing tasks. Treat it like a business.\n\nP.S. If you like I could do one for paid traffic as well.\n\nEdit: you asked for it, so here it is: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Affiliatemarketing/comments/11yqzez/your\\_simple\\_plan\\_for\\_paid\\_traffic\\_affiliate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Affiliatemarketing/comments/11yqzez/your_simple_plan_for_paid_traffic_affiliate/)",

      "selftext": "I did a [post yesterday about organic traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Affiliatemarketing/comments/11xu0js/your_simple_game_plan_for_organic_traffic/) and you asked for a paid traffic plan, so here it is...\n\nThese steps will be a bit more difficult, because it involves tracking and multiple platforms like ad networks that all have a certain learning curve. But if you're willing to put in the time to learn, the payoff can be huge. This is because paid traffic is scalable.\n\nLet's say you start with a test budget of $5 per day and after 2 weeks you optimized your campaign based on your tracking data, so that it yields $8 on average for every $5 spent (ROAS, return on ad spend). There's no one stopping you to scale to $500 a day or even $5,000 a day.\n\nOf course you will need cashflow to scale and there's a limit to the volume you can get on the network. Offers can also have a cap on how many leads/sales they can handle. So always ask your AM before you start scaling. This is also a good time to ask for a payout bump! ;)\n\nNote: Unlike organic traffic (which will only cost you time) you'll need some capital to get into the paid traffic game. Tracking software is a must and you will need an initial testbudget.\n\n**For paid traffic this would be your simple game plan:**\n\n1. Register as a business. This will greatly help you get into affiliate networks, especially with paid traffic, because you won't have a content site to show them. It's relatively cheap to get a US LLC. or UK LTD.\n2. Buy a top level domain and email for your business (namecheap.com).\n3. Create a professional looking website for your business, explaining how you do media buying and performance marketing. Fake it till you make it. (you can do this for free at gosysteme.com)\n4. Pick a niche. You can probably make anything work, but good niches for paid traffic are:  financial trading, dating, sweepstakes, insurance, health/weight loss, skincare, bizz op, crypto, sports. (I've personally had a lot of success with financial trading offers).\n5. Apply for affiliate networks that have offers in your niche with your new business email. Some examples are Golden Goose, MaxBounty, Zeydoo, ClickDealer, CrakRevenue, LosPollos, AdsEmpire, Advidi. Some of these will be easier to get into than others. Make sure you look up tutorials on how to get accepted. You can also find offers for your niche on websites like Offervault.\n6. Talk to your affiliate manager, ask them what the best converting offers are and pick one.\n7. Find a traffic source. Check the TOS of the ad network. Not all networks allow all offers and marketing methods. There's different kinds of traffic like pop, push, display, redirect, native, mobile. Some will be better suitable for your offer than others. For example mobile is obviously good for app installs, native ads is good for financial and bizzop. Besides the big ones like Google and Meta there's many others like: PropellerAds, Revcontent, AdsTerra, Bidvertiser, Exoclick, etc..\n8. Buy tracking software. This is a MUST! If you don't track, you're shooting in the dark and can't optimize. I use Voluum, but there are others like RedTrack. These trackers offer integration with the big CPA networks (templates).\n9. Get hosting and landing page builder (free at [Systeme](https://gosysteme.com)).\n10. Think of a unique angle and create your landing page or multistep funnel.\n11. Get creatives from your network or make your own.\n12. Setup the campaign in your tracker and ad network.\n13. Optimize your campaign based on the data you gather. Only keep the stuff that's converting. Remove certain devices, countries, time of day, creatives, etc.\n14. Cut losers and scale winners.\n\nAlways keep testing even when your campaign is profitable. Split test offers, different landing pages, bidding strategies, etc. You can easily do this in your tracking software. This will improve your ROAS.\n\nOptional: buy a spy tool like Anstrex or Adplexity. See what's working for other and improve on that (don't steal campaigns).\n\nAs you can see there's a lot more involved here than getting organic traffic, but the rewards are far greater. Simply because of the fact you can scale your campaigns. There are super affiliates doing 6 figures a month by running paid ads.\n\nThere will be less free information about this on YouTube, but there are some forums like Stack That Money (STM), which are completely focused on paid traffic.\n\nI hope this helps. Give me a like if it does and feel free to ask questions.",

      "title": "Why are so many young people leaving the profession? I'll tell you. ",
      "selftext": "For context, I'm Director at Big 4, in my early 30s based in London. My experiences aren't going to be the same as everyone else's and this post is not meant to be a universal answer to attrition or job satisfaction within the industry, It's a reflection on my time within the consulting industry and the changes I have seen since starting out:\n\nI am increasingly asked the same question by senior management within my department: 'Why don't our consultants want to stay with us past the junior grades?', 'Why do they keep moving out to worse paying, less dynamic jobs?', 'Why do we keep haemorrhaging the experience we have built within the team?'. Senior (read older) figures are flabbergasted that junior staff would want to leave this industry for seemingly mundane jobs elsewhere. \n\nThe simple answer to all of these questions is: 'Consulting is not what is once was'. \n\nIt's not the same career as when they started out, it's not even the same career as when I started out. \n\nConsulting used to be a pretty good gig. It was (broadly) well thought of, well paid, dynamic and interesting and had great career prospects should you be successful. However the attributes that once made this a top tier career have gradually been eroded by greed. Below I will list the key changes through the course of my career which I believe have contributed to the devaluation of consulting as a career choice. \n\n1) The Loss of Perks - The often touted lifestyle of a consultant used to be attractive to many young people. Flying all over the continent, dinners with clients, nights out with the team in far flung destinations, adventure and life experiences. Certainly, looking back even 10 years ago, consultants used to have a plethora of travel and social opportunities should they desire. \n\nIt made the tedium of correcting a PowerPoint for the 17th time bearable, it made visiting irritating clients worth it and it afforded us the opportunity to visit places we would have otherwise probably not chosen to go. Granted, most of the time it was a budget flight, a visit to a commercial estate out of town, a dinner and a drink in an average restaurant and then a fitful night of sleep in a three star hotel. But on occasion, the stars aligned and some truly amazing memories were created. Not to mention the tangential benefits of accruing points for your chosen airline of hotel chain for personal use later. \n\nBut now, corporate cards are reduced to ornaments, travel is restricted under the dubious auspices of ESG and any activity outside of what is deemed strictly necessary is deemed to be an excess too far. All in the name of the bottom line. \n\n2) The Loss of the Collegiate Environment - I'm prepared to be hounded by the angry 'WFH Mafia' on this one so I will preface this by saying that I know that the office environment isn't for everyone. However, I strongly believe that bonds between colleagues, especially at the genesis of a career is incredibly important for a feeling of overall job satisfaction. This may be a bit of an outdated idea, and perhaps leaves me open to accusations of being a dinosaur but I'm willing to live with that. \n\nI'm not looking forward to coming to work to create shareholder value, I'm not looking forward to coming into work to interrogate a spreadsheet, to have a call with a client or even to make a presentation to a Partner. I'm looking forward to coming into work because my colleagues make it bearable. Constantly tapping away from in front of my screen on my kitchen table in a shared flat is more depressing than 1000 cringe pizza parties. Once again, I appreciate that this doesn't apply to everyone, but I know for a fact that some, especially more junior consultants, genuinely want the opportunity to have the office team experience on SOME DAYS. \n\nBut, even if they wanted to, they can't. Cutbacks in office space and the introduction of extreme hotdesking mean that fostering this kind of environment is increasingly impossible. Want to get an area for your team? Good luck - try booking it three months in advance. Teams can no longer come into the office and confidently  expect to be sat within 20 meters of one another. It's incredibly difficult to foster any sort of Team camaraderie.\n\nWithout colleagues or perks, the stark reality of the job creeps in, consultants realise that the extent of their job is actually just copy, paste and ppt creation. There is nothing to mask it, and without the mask, the career is farcical.  \n\n3) The dilution of the Partner Grade - Whilst not in the front of mind for everyone, a significant number of consultants come into the business with the aim of one day becoming a partner. Partners make the big bucks, they take a home a share of the profits and they get to direct the running of the practice. It's a milestone in your career, a reward for all the hard work. Right? Well, it used to be.\n\nThe above description more accurately describes the Equity Partner position within most firms. In order to ensure that these equity partners are insulted from profit share dilution associated with increasing their ranks, 'Junior' or salary partner positions have been created within most firms. These are partners in name only, they do not receive a profit share and they aren't on the Partnership agreement. \n\nIn practice, you are now going to be waiting much longer into your career before you get any sort of 'slice of the pie'. And that's if you are lucky enough that the existing Partners don't sell you out to private equity before you get there. \n\nFor a lot of people it's just not worth it without the goal of partnership within a reasonable amount of time. \n\n4) Decrease in Value - Finally, I have seen a steady decrease in the value (or at least perceived value) delivered to clients. Increasingly, consultants are seen as chancers who come in, tell the client what they already know and then bill large amounts of money without creating any real value. This used to be a meme, a funny joke, not something reflected in reality. But as Partners or Shareholders continue to look for dollars and cents on the bottom line, I have seen a real and sustained decrease in the value of the work provided to clients. Corner cutting, over promising, generic delivery and overbilling have all become more prevalent over the past 10 years (anecdotally of course).\n\nA downturn in the value of our product perpetuates the stereotype of consultancy as a career for frauds, drives talent out of the industry and thus increases the chances of poor quality work in the future. A vicious cycle and a self fulfilling prophecy. \n\n/TLDR and in Conclusion: Consultancy is no longer attractive to young people, due in large part to greed: It has been stripped of its perks, had it's career trajectory blunted and its reputation left in tatters. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "Hello fellow SaaS builders. My name is Jacob &amp; I'm the founder of /r/Rezi. https://www.rezi.ai/\n\nRezi is the #1 AI resume software known for creating resumes that force the user to follow best practices so they land an interview.\n\nI started the company approximately 9 years ago, shortly after graduating college.\n\nI faced the pain-point myself. In college, I had a 2.2 GPA yet still managed to get interviews at companies like Dropbox, Google, EA, Goldman Sachs, &amp; Kaplan.\n\nI realized that the secret to getting invited to interviews was my resume. Learning how to optimize your resume will give you an edge rather than mindlessly applying for 1000s of positions.\n\nMy secrets to land more interviews:\n\n**Beating the ATS:** Most large companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter resumes before a person even sees them. You have to create a resume tailored to the exact job description.\n\n- Use the right keywords: Scan the job description and make sure those exact words and phrases are in your resume.\n\n- Keep formatting simple: ATS can't always read fancy formatting. Stick to clear fonts and basic bullet points.\n\n**Details, Details, Details:** Don't just say what you did; explain the what, why, and how of each task or accomplishment.\n\n- For example, instead of writing, \"Managed social media,\" write: \"Developed and executed a social media content calendar that increased engagement by 20% in six months using platform analytics and A/B testing.\"\n\n**Tailor Every Single Time:** Yes, it's a pain, but you need to customize your resume for each job application.\n\n- Focus on the job description: Highlight the skills and experiences that are most relevant to that specific role.\n\n- Mirror the language: Use the same terminology that is used in the job posting. Chris Voss recommends mirroring the language even in high-stakes negotiations.\n\n**Formatting Matters More Than You Think:** A clean, easy-to-read resume makes a big difference.\n\n- Use simple fonts like Arial or Times New Roman.\n\n- Use consistent bullet points.\n\n- Use clear section headings.\n\n\nAnd so I made a post on Reddit sharing my resume template. It went viral and many people were asking for the template so I thought why not create a website and sell the template there. That was how Rezi came about.\n\nOver the next few years, I moved to South Korea to explore the growing tech scene in 2016. I ultimately raised some angel investment, built a basic software prototype of the resume template, launched that for free, and further validated the idea with technology and then ultimately launched Rezi as it is today, and that was five years ago.\n\nWe recently crossed $5.4 million in lifetime revenue, which you can verify on the Indiepage Leaderboard, where we're ranked #1.\n\nAsk me anything about resumes, building a SaaS, fundraising, SEO, or anything that comes to your mind.\n\nI’m super happy to share resume tips as well to help you land better jobs or even any job if you have been one of the unlucky ones. AI has killed a lot of jobs for juniors (look up Fiverr/Upwork stock) in 2024 &amp; in 2025, it'll kill even more jobs (ahem.. web developers) so I know what its like. If you don't wanna ask publicly, do ask privately in DMs but publicly would be better as others can learn from your question.\n\nAlrighttt gooo!!!",

Here's the raw, unfiltered story of how it happened:\n\n# Numbers, Because Reddit Loves Data\n\n* 👥 6000+ active users\n* 🌍 Paying customers from 45+ countries\n* ⭐ 4.7/5 stars on Chrome Web Store\n* 💰 $0 spent on marketing\n* 🕒 14-hour days, 7 days/week in the beginning\n* 📦 200+ updates shipped\n\n# The Journey\n\nIt started on a rooftop cafe in Delhi. I had just quit my job, was questioning all my life choices, and was brainstorming ideas with an old friend. That night, I had a simple thought: \"What if I build something that helps developers fix UI issues faster?\"\n\nNo market research. No fancy business plan. Just opened VS Code and started coding.\n\n# Reality Check Moments\n\n* Month 1-3: Lived off savings, coded 14 hours daily\n* Month 4: First launch on ProductHunt - got 200+ upvotes\n* Month 6: Extension went viral in Japan (97k views)\n* Month 7: Finally launched paid version - 8 sales first week\n* Month 8: Built a proper website - sales quadrupled\n* Month 25: Featured on Chrome Web Store (feels unreal)\n\n# Hard Truths Nobody Talks About\n\n* Spent countless nights debugging Chrome APIs\n* Lived with constant anxiety about running out of savings\n* Kept the extension free for 7 months while bleeding money\n* Still do everything solo - development, support, marketing\n* Turned down VC funding to keep full control\n\n# What Worked, Surprisingly\n\n1. Keeping it free longer than comfortable\n2. Obsessing over product quality and user feedback\n3. Shipping updates even when nobody asked\n4. ProductHunt launch as \"free and open-source\"\n\nIt's called [SuperDev Pro](https://superdevpro.com) \\- helps developers and designers fix UI issues 3x faster. If you're curious, you can check it out, but that's not why I'm posting. Just wanted to share that it's possible to survive (and eventually thrive) by building something useful, even if it seems small.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone. Tommy here. I'm 3.\n\nFour days ago I was watching cocomelon on my iPad when YouTube autoplay threw on a Dan Martell video. Something about \"buy back your time\" resonated with me - mostly because nap time was cutting into my block-stacking sessions.\n\nDan said something like \"find a problem, build a solution, scale it.\" I looked around my daycare and noticed a clear market gap: nobody was monitoring the structural integrity of our block towers. Silent failures everywhere. Millions in imaginary revenue at risk.\n\nSo I opened up Bubble (my fine motor skills aren't great yet, but I can drag and drop). Built \"BlockGuard\" - real-time monitoring for block tower stability with AI-powered collapse predictions. Integrated Stripe because that's what Dan said to do.\n\nLaunched on Product Hunt Tuesday morning (right after Paw Patrol). By Wednesday we hit $30M MRR. Thursday morning a16z called during snack time and offered $1.2B. I accepted because I wanted to get back to my blocks.\n\n**Here's what I learned:**\n\n1. **Solve real problems** \\- Block tower collapses were costing my peers valuable play time\n2. **Move fast** \\- The window between breakfast and morning nap is shorter than you think\n3. **Charge what you're worth** \\- I initially priced at $0.50/month (one fruit snack). Raised to $99/month. Nobody blinked.\n4. **AI is a moat** \\- Used Claude API to predict collapses 30 seconds before they happened. Game changer.\n5. **Compete on speed** \\- While other kids were still learning ABCs, I was learning ARR\n6. **Know when to exit** \\- $1.2B lets me buy a lot of goldfish crackers\n\n**The boring stuff:**\n\n* Tech stack: Bubble + Supabase + Claude API (couldn't figure out AWS, I'm only 3)\n* Customer acquisition: Posted in r/blocks, got 47 beta users\n* First revenue: 6 hours after launch\n* Used [FailureFinder.com](http://FailureFinder.com) to monitor my Zapier automations because even at $30M MRR, broken workflows will kill you\n\n**What's next:** Honestly? Probably fingerpainting. I'm diversifying into physical art because that's what all the successful founders do after an exit.\n\nHappy to answer questions, but I've got a juice box calling my name.\n\n\\- Tommy, 3",

      "title": "How I hacked growth on Reddit to build a $1M SaaS",
      "selftext": "Hey fellow founders! I used Reddit to grow a million dollar saas, and wanted to share how I did it.\n\nNow that AI content is popping up everywhere, Reddit is imo one of the best ways to spend your time if you want to grow a SaaS. Also, head of growth at some of the fastest growing SaaS in the world like Deel also used Reddit. Why?\n\n(1) Google now promotes Reddit on the top of the SERP for ALOT of long tail search terms.\n\n(2) OpenAI, etc. train on Reddit data -&gt; so you will get generative search benefits too.\n\n(3) People go to Reddit to get honest and transparent advice on software to buy, etc. (and even search for \"keyword + Reddit\" on Google). They are tired of sponsored blog post and AI content.\n\nI've successfully used both comments and posts with over +1M views - to get a ton of demos and sign deals for my startup from Reddit. DMs do not work well from my experience.\n\nHere are 5 ways how to use Reddit for growing my SaaS:\n\n1. Find relevant subreddits: needs to (A) contain your ideal customer + (B) be large enough if you are creating posts (&gt;50K members).\n2. Become a contributor: start to build karma. I started out upvoting + commenting, and finally got into posting once I figured things out. Tailor your posts to the specific subreddits to be hyper relevant and bring value.\n3. Use an alert tool + build keyword list: Commenting on relevant posts that mention problems, question, and competitors in your space, is one of the most efficient ways to get leads. Finding those can either (A) be done manually, by searching on weekly basis using the built-in search bar), or (B) using an automized tool like f5bot (free). Build our keyword list out as you go.\n4. Creating viral posts: Posting can get you a crazy amount of views if you do things right - and put you (and your startup) in the center of the conversation. 4 types of posts that have worked well for me are (i) the relatable post (ii) the guide post (similar to this one) (iii) the conversation starter (iv) the story post.\n5. Buckle up, play by the rules, and shoot your shot: Aim to give 95% value, 5% plug your startup. No direct links, no spam, no corporate bs. Write like a human would. Be transparent, provide big value, and finally mention your startup. Either as a comment, or in the original post.\n\nGreat founders spend their time (a) talking to users (b) building. Reddit is awesome to do (a) - get conversations, feedback, and understand you target persona. So go out there, contribute, and build your saas.\n\nIf you are curious i put together a youtube video where i share screenshots and examples on all of this. let me know if you want the video link, have any questions - happy to answer and help out!\n\nEDIT: Didn't expect this to blow up! Seems a lot of people found this helpful. I've decided to turn this post into my first book(!) Transparently sharing my full playbook to growth hacking on Reddit. Check it out [here](https://growthhackingreddit.com/) if curious. Also linked my YT video there.",

We've demoed it to 50+ practices.

You get money upfront but customers still renew.If you must do LTDs, cap the number ruthlessly. 50 max. Create scarcity.Never offer lifetime on a product that has ongoing server costs. You're signing up to lose money on every user forever.The AppSumo crowd isn't your target market. They're deal hunters who buy everything and use nothing.

Identify real problems you understand deeply\n2. Use your unique skills and experiences to solve them\n3. Build genuine expertise over time\n4. Create value before thinking about monetization\n\nTake a breath and ask yourself: \n\nWhat are you genuinely good at?\n\nWhat problems do you understand better than others?\n\nWhat skills could you develop into real expertise?\n\nLet's stop building for the sake of building. Let's start building for purpose - and **if your purpose is making money, start learning sales, not coding.**",

      "selftext": "Solo founder here. I hit $20k MRR with zero employees, zero ads, and $0 marketing budget. The playbook nobody talks about.\n\nLook, I know another \"how I made it\" post... but hear me out.\n\nI see you grinding at 2 AM, wondering if you should dump your last $2k into Google Ads. **Don't.** \n\nI wasted 6 months and $8k on ads before I realized something - as a solo founder, you have superpowers that VC-backed teams don't. Here's exactly how I leveraged them:\n\n## 1. The \"One Person, Everywhere\" Illusion\n\nBig companies need meetings to tweet. You don't. \n\nI literally set up alerts for every keyword related to my niche. Responded to every relevant question on Twitter, Reddit, indie hackers, and random forums within 5 minutes for 6 months straight. People thought I was a team of 10. \n\nReality: Just me with my phone notifications turned up to 11.\n\n## 2. Fuck Your Roadmap\n\nThis one's controversial but... I threw away my beautiful 12-month roadmap.\n\nStarted shipping what users asked for THIS WEEK. Like, literally built features while on Zoom calls with customers. One dude watched me code his feature request live. He referred 6 customers that month.\n\nYour agility is your moat. Use it.\n\n## 3. The Pricing Paradox That Saved My Sanity\n\nOk this sounds insane but I 5x'd my prices overnight. Lost 80% of customers. Doubled my revenue.\n\nBut here's the kicker - higher-paying customers actually need LESS support. My support time went from 20 hours/week to 2. \n\nI'm not joking. The $9/month users will email you about button colors. The $97/month users just want it to work.\n\n## 4. The \"Boring Marketing\" Goldmine\n\nWhile everyone's trying to go viral on TikTok, I did the most unsexy thing possible...\n\nWrote 200 blog posts answering the most boring questions my exact customers Google at 3 PM on a Tuesday. Stuff like \"how to export CSV from [competitor]\" or \"[specific feature] not working fix\"\n\nNow I get ~50 signups/month on complete autopilot. Been steady for 8 months.\n\n## 5. Competitor's Worst Nightmare Strategy\n\nThis is borderline evil but... \n\n- Set up Google alerts for \"[competitor] alternative\"\n- Made a comparison page for every major competitor\n- Hung out in their support forums and helped people (genuinely helped, not spammed)\n- Created guides for migrating FROM their tool\n\n40% of my MRR is competitor refugees. Sorry not sorry.\n\n## The Solo Founder's Actual Edge\n\nYou can't outspend them. You can't out-hire them. You can't out-build them.\n\nBut you can out-care them. \n\nEvery customer knows my name. Every feature request gets a personal Loom video response (even if it's a \"no\"). Every churned user gets a personal email asking what I could've done better.\n\nBig companies can't do this. Their support team doesn't know their CTO. You ARE the CTO.\n\n## Why Ads Are a Solo Founder Trap\n\nReal talk - ads need constant feeding. New creatives, split tests, landing page optimization, tracking pixels, attribution windows... \n\nThat's literally a full-time job. You know what you should be doing instead? Building shit that compounds while you sleep.\n\n## My Actual Daily Stack (Total cost: $0)\n\nMorning (30 min):\n- Check Reddit/Twitter mentions, respond to everything\n- Record 2-3 personalized Loom onboardings for new signups\n\nAfternoon:\n- One customer call (they book directly via Cal.com)\n- Ship one thing (even if tiny)\n\nEvening:\n- Write one piece of content (blog, tweet thread, whatever)\n\nThat's it. No fancy automation. No virtual assistants. No growth hacks.\n\n## The Plot Twist\n\nI still surf every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon. I take weekends completely off. I went to Japan for 3 weeks and revenue went UP.\n\nBecause sustainable &gt; scalable when you're solo.\n\nYou don't need to work 100 hour weeks. You need to work on the RIGHT things for 20-30 focused hours.\n\n---\n\nLook, I'm not saying this works for everyone. B2B SaaS is different from consumer apps. But if you're a solo founder selling to SMBs or prosumers, this shit works.\n\nThe best part? When VCs eventually come knocking (and they will), you can tell them to fuck off because you don't need them.\n\n**EDIT:** Holy shit this blew up. My DMs are cooked but I'm trying to respond to everyone. Solo founders gotta stick together 🤝",

      "title": "My non-AI app made $8000 USD in 2 months. Here’s how I did it",
      "selftext": "I’ve been building AI wrappers for the past 3 years as an indie hacker. None of them became profitable. Building failed products taught me how to code, design and market properly. And one day all those skills paid out \n\n**The idea**\n\n2 months ago Skype announced it was closing down. Most people used Skype for video calls, but there was a niche of people who used Skype to make cheap international calls to mobile and landline numbers. That was a golden opportunity – major playing leaving the market, and its users scrambling for an alternative.\n\nThat’s how I made Yadaphone. I took one feature of Skype I used myself – making cheap overseas calls, and created a website that allowed people to do it.\n\n**Launch**\n\nI built an MVP in a weekend. The design was minimalist, landing non-existent, but the app worked – you could sign up, buy credits and call. I wrote a quick post on r/Skype. It got removed in an hour, but it was enough to get my first users. This is where I got real lucky for first time. One of users, became a super-fan of my product. He started giving a lot of feedback and promoting my app among his friends. His testimonial is still featured on my landing page (hi Nico!).\n\n**Promotion**\n\nReddit was great to get the first users, but the traffic from it depends on my creativity and people upvoting the posts. I couldn’t rely solely on it. That’s when I decided it was time for the Product Hunt launch. I prepared everything, but was so stressed with support requests, that when the launch came … I forgot about it. \n\n2 hours into the launch I looked at my phone and saw people upvoting Yadaphone. I panicked and started spamming about it in all my social media. I also sent an email to all my existing users – and it was super helpful. My own users started uploading the product, and we finished 11th that day – earning us a featured badge and a really strong backlink from PH.\n\n**Growth**\n\nPH launch was also useful, because this is how we got our first b2b customers. Next day after launch, a guy texted me out of the blue saying he wanted an enterprise plan for his company. I said, sure I’ll get back to ya (of course I didn’t have an enterprise plan back then). I coded the organization management logic in a night, and the next morning was presenting my solution to his company of 20 people. That worked, we onboarded him and the next day I got a Stripe notification of several hundred bucks. It felt surreal.\n\n**What didn’t work**\n\n* Paid traffic\n\nI tried paid traffic on Google, Reddit, LinkedIn, and Facebook. None of them worked. The worst by far is Reddit. Reddit ads are mostly bots who are not even active on the website.\n\nWhat I learned is that social media paid traffic will only work if you already have viral posts that you can promote even further. Otherwise it’s a waste of money. Google works if you target a super niche keyword (example: target the keyword “calls to the United States” and have a specific page built for this keyword).\n\n* TikTok and Insta reels\n\nI tried posting reels, but this was a pure waste of effort. None of them got any views. I still think it can be a good source of traffic, but you need to know what you are doing.\n\n**What worked**\n\n* Reddit. Great source of traffic, great audience (just don’t get banned for promotion)\n* Twitter/X. One of my tweets was reposted by Pieter Levels. It got 200k views, a ton of publicity and sales. I still post to Twitter every day. Great marketing channel\n* Collaborations with journalists. Yadaphone got featured early as one of top Skype alternatives in a well-ranked article. Good for domain authority and traffic\n* Linkedin content. LinkedIn is so filled with AI content, if you post something genuine, you are guaranteed to get engagement. I post to LinkedIn every day. Sometimes about Yadaphone, sometimes stuff related to products in general (for example, I made an overview of top Reddit startups launches recently). Good reactions, and shows that you as a founder stay behind you work\n\nThis was an overview of my experience launching a profitable non-AI product as an indie hacker. I would be happy to answer any questions you guys have!",

      "selftext": "A few months back I had like 12 different SaaS ideas scattered across Notion docs and honestly no clue which one people actually gave a shit about\n\nYou know the drill - everyone says \"talk to your users\" and \"validate first\" but like... where exactly are these mystical users hanging out? And what am I supposed to ask them without sounding like a weirdo with a survey\n\nDid what any rational developer would do - ignored the advice completely and just started building stuff\n\nBuilt two different projects. First one got exactly 3 signups. Second one never even made it past my localhost because I lost steam halfway through\n\nClassic mistake: I was building solutions to problems I had, not problems other people were willing to pay to solve\n\nThen I got curious about using AI differently. Not for idea generation (because that usually spits out generic nonsense) but for actual market research\n\n**Here's what I did:**\n\nOn Claude, I activated the research option and then prompt it to scrape through real user content - Reddit threads, Quora answers, G2 reviews, anywhere people complain about stuff. Told it to focus on one specific area: \"cold email personalization problems\"\n\nIt came back with this insane 3-page breakdown. Real quotes from sales people bitching about how their templates suck, how manual personalization takes forever, how their reply rates are trash\n\nThen I asked it to rate the opportunity 1-10 based on demand vs competition. Got an 8.5 with solid reasoning about why the market gap exists\n\nThat was enough validation for me to actually commit, cause the AI was mainly using the researched data as source of truth, not their knowlege :)\n\nBuilt Introwarm - you upload your prospect list and it generates personalized email openers by checking what they're posting, reacting to, sharing, etc. online\n\nSoft launched it without any fanfare. Got my first paid customer ($29) in week 2 after launch. Now sitting at $2.3k MRR and growing mostly through cold outreach (yes, using my own tool) and posting in communities like this\n\n**What actually worked:**\n\n* People are constantly venting online about their problems. That's free market research if you know where to look\n* AI can synthesize patterns way faster than manually reading through hundreds of complaints\n* You don't need perfect validation - just enough signal to know you're not completely delusional\n\nIf you're stuck between ideas, try this instead of endless brainstorming: find where your target users are already complaining and let them tell you what to build",

      "title": "I ran $2200 worth of paid ads (no prior experience). This is what I learnt.",
      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I spent the last week doing paid ads to grow my app to 10K users.I’ve never (seriously) done paid ads before so everything’s new to me. Here’s what I did &amp; learned:\n\n1. **(Didn’t work) Google Ads:** I started off with Google Ads after randomly finding a coupon for $600 more if you spend $600. I set up a performance max campaign with a budget of $10/day. I got a CPC for $0.05! I tried creating a second campaign with different keywords, targeting and it went to $4.50 CPC (spent $50 total). Ended up shutting down these campaigns. The most annoying thing? They show you conversion data after a day. I was running a $10 campaign, saw nothing was happening so I bumped it up and turns out the next day it ws running and it had a $7 CPC. Insane!\n   1. I think that ad coupon was a trap because you start overspending just to get the additional money which is bad.\n2. **(Worked the best) Meta Ads:** I set up Meta ads for only Desktop because my app doesn’t work on Mobile. The biggest issue with Meta is that it has a lot of surfaces and if you upload an image, it will show them on all those surfaces but the sizing will be off so it looks ugly. Instead I went to Canva and created a different image size for each surface, starting with a 1:1 because it’s easy to crop for other dimensions.\n   1. The targeting settings were superb in Facebook. I saw in my app analytics that most of my customers are from US, Brazil, Philippines and Mexico so I created a campaign for:\n      1. Social media agencies in each of those countries\n      2. Ghostwriters in each of those countries\n      3. Everybody in US\n   2. For US the CPC was $1.50 but I saw that for other countries, it was as low as $0.35 so I turned off the US and increased the spent to others. Eventually the CPC came down to 2 cents which was incredible.\n3. **(Didn’t work)** **Tiktok Ads:** I should have spent a little more time on Tiktok ads but I wasn’t fully convinced they would work. I literally just boosted [an existing Tiktok video](https://www.tiktok.com/@thisissukh_/video/7443990792160546103) I had recorded for $5/day. It did get more views but nothing much on the conversions. I think you would want to spend more time creating a lot of videos, see the ones that work and then boost those vs. taking a bad video and boosting it.\n4. **(Waste of money) Reddit Ads:** I think Reddit has the best UI for ads (Good lord others are bad) but I think COULD NOT use it because the ads stayed in “Review mode” for a whole week and never ran. I even messaged support, no help. The good thing about Reddit is that you can 1-click import your Meta ads which is nice.\n5. **(Worked decently) Newsletter Ads:** I found a bunch of AI/Design newsletters varying from 50K to 300K subscribers. Of course they give you a huge burst of traffic when they go out and then immediately die out. I like newsletters because they are quick and you can get a more higher quality user over social media ads (which could be anyone). That being said, the link click conversions are generally 1-2% I’ve seen. One good thing I found is that newsletter operators are very open to price negotiation. You can generally get $100 discount if you ask the right way. Also, it’s helpful to organize your assets, copy prior to in a [Google Doc like this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KYvVlShqyqrJ3hAbiYr7WM0u1bfAzOPiFg1LxLSnDYM/edit?tab=t.0). If you don’t do this, they will just write the copy themselves with ChatGPT and it’s generally awful.\n\nHopefully this helps someone here!\n\n\\----  \nEdit: Holy shit this blew up!

I get that nothing in this world comes for free.\n\nBut here’s the thing I can’t shake: *how many lives do we get?* **One**. Not one and a half. Not two. Just one. So why the hell would I keep putting my dreams on hold—waiting for summer, for vacation days, for the next weekend? Why wait for the “perfect time” that might never come?\n\nI’ve decided to start now. Tonight, if I have to. Yeah, I’ll lose sleep, but not over some boring project or a dead-end job. I’m losing sleep over something bigger—a passion, a vision, a plan for my life that’s crystal clear in my head. A dream that just needs me to make it real.\n\nSo if you’ve read this far, wish me luck. And if you’re anything like me, grab that thing you love and make it happen. And if it doesn’t work out? Screw it—start again!",

Most of us here hardly found any success. If one product fails, we go build an another one in a week, launch 12 startups in 12 months, do tiktok reels, shitpost in twitter, go viral on Reddit, etc, etc. \n\n We’re stuck in an echo chamber. Wake up. \n\nI haven’t built anything wildly successful yet — so this isn’t advice from someone who's made it. I’m just in the same zone as many of you. But I can’t shake the feeling that something isn’t right.\n\nThe more I scrolled Twitter and Reddit, the more my ideas started to orbit this tiny solar system of indie makers. It felt like I was building something valuable, but not really. \n\nI started talking to friends, one is into mechanical tools and another runs an electronics blog — my ideas meant nothing to them or their business. \n\nThey were struggling with real stuff — inventory management, getting prospects, tracking employee attendance, delivery delays, managing cash flow. Not one of them cared about my Notion dashboard or AI-powered productivity tracker.\n\nThat was the slap.\n\nSince then, I’ve been trying to consciously spend less time on X and Reddit, and more time reading other news, talking to friends and business owners,  attending real-world meetups, taking a tour of their offices.  I’m asking questions, observing processes, and just trying to be useful. It’s reshaping how I think about products completely.\n\nThere’s a quote that floats around on Twitter - Build for people who don’t know what an API or AI wrapper is. That’s exactly what I’m talking about.\n\nDon’t get me wrong—this community is amazing and it got me started. I still love it. But if you’ve been here for months and you’re still building for other builders… maybe it’s time to zoom out.\n\nYour next best idea might come from a casual chat with your barber — not from another r/SaaS post.\n\nAnyone else feeling this ?\n",

      "selftext": "What a Data Analyst Does :\nA data analyst is the person a company turns to when they already have data and need to understand it. The job is about taking raw information, cleaning it up so it’s usable, and then presenting it in a way that makes sense to people who don’t live in spreadsheets all day.\nYou might pull numbers from a database with SQL, organize them in Excel, and then create dashboards or charts in Tableau or Power BI.\nMost of the work focuses on describing what happened in the past and figuring out why. For example: “Why did sales drop last quarter?” or “Which product category is growing the fastest?”\nAnalysts live in structured data (tables, rows, columns) and need to be able to explain their findings clearly to non-technical audiences.\n\nWhat a Data Scientist Does :\nA data scientist goes beyond explaining the past. The role is about building models and algorithms that can make predictions or automate decisions.\nThis means more coding (usually in Python or R), heavier use of statistics, and sometimes machine learning.\nInstead of just answering “Why did sales drop?” a data scientist might build a model that predicts which customers are likely to leave next month, so the business can take action in advance.\nData scientists often deal with messier, unstructured data like text, images, or logs, and they run experiments to test different approaches. The role sits closer to engineering than business operations.\n\nMindset Difference :\nAnalysts focus on What happened? and Why did it happen?\nScientists focus on What’s likely to happen next? and What should we do about it?\nAnalysts interpret the past; scientists try to shape the future.\n\nSkills and Tools :\n\nAnalyst: SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, basic stats, business domain knowledge.\n\nScientist: Python/R, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, advanced stats, machine learning, some data engineering.\n\nCareer Paths : \nAnalysts often grow into senior analyst or BI roles, or add technical depth to move into data science.\nData scientists can progress into ML engineering, AI research, or lead data teams.\nPay is generally higher for data scientists, but the technical bar is also higher.\n\nWhich Role to Choose :\nIf you like telling a clear story with data and working closely with decision-makers, start with Data Analyst.\nIf you’re drawn to coding, algorithms, and building predictive systems, aim for Data Scientist but, be prepared for a steeper learning curve.\n\nBottom Line :\nBoth are valuable. Analysts explain the past. Scientists predict the future.\nThe best choice depends on whether you want to interpret data or build tools that act on it.",

I froze when they asked me to explain why I chose one feature over another. I panicked, tried to justify with vague intuition, and later realized I hadn’t even mentioned scaling or outlier handling.\n\nAfter that, I still drill algorithms, statistics, Python, but I'd also pair that with the usual: peer review, whiteboarding with a friend, flashcards for edge cases.

      "selftext": "My background is strong in certain aspects (theory, relatively publicly prominent work, etc.) but weak in a really, really crucial one (I have zero industry experience, coming from academia!). In light of many friends I thought were far more qualified than I, I kind of ignored their suggestions for job applying (apply literally everywhere!) in light of their experiences (I think my friends are pretty consistent with most of the community; something like a 5% interview rate and \\~1% offer rate? brutal.). I applied to maybe 15 or 20 what I considered \"safety\" jobs; jobs that paid kinda bad relative what I thought I was worth, with much lower tier companies (startups in my areas of expertise, small businesses, etc). I got either no response (\\~8 of the 20) or straight rejected (\\~12 of the 20) from all of these, over 2.5 months. Literal 0 interviews.\n\nFor the jobs I actually wanted, I did a lot more due diligence than anybody I know. I'll use meta as an example (note: I did not actually end up applying to meta, but for sake of comparison). I found people on linkedin using search tags (Meta + my degree + &lt;desired position&gt;) who looked a lot like me either currently or in their past. And then I cold messaged them. A decent number of them (maybe 3-8 per company, basically just until I got a reply). Asking for advice on their transitions, how they went, etc. I prepped for each of these video chats like you would for a behavioral interview. To my surprise, about 50% of the people I contacted (many of whom were extremely high up) were more than happy to help out. Several actually looked at my resume and gave very helpful tips. I got multiple good conversations out of most of them, as well, so it wasn't just a 1-off video chat. Several put me in direct contact with HMs for the jobs I wanted, or PMs. I ended up with referrals from people whose titles ranged from senior &lt;position&gt; to Director of &lt;division to which I was applying&gt;. Obviously this took a while, but in the 2 months I was implementing this approach, I got 3 job offers from what I considered \"reaches\" (2 FAANG + one top pharma) out of about 6 applications to these 3 companies, for a 50% return rate. I had only done this for 3 companies because it is a lot of time and effort obviously, but I was planning to do it for a lot more, as I didn't realize how successful it would be.\n\nSo, just a word of advice: network, network, network. To my surprise, it seems to matter a lot more than volume. As a disclaimer, I think I come off as quite intelligent and personable, so YMMV if that's not you. But people were very willing to help, much more so than I possibly could have expected, which got my foot in the door. Which in this job market, is kind of everything just because of how much volume there is for open positions (several of the FAANG jobs that I was offered had 500+ applications on linkedin alone; absolutely insane). So, before pressing submit on 200 job applications, think about whether you might get more mileage networking first. Maybe this is small-sample bias; I don't know. but 0% in the lower-tier pool vs 50% in what I consider the higher-tier is a kind of big disparity for it to be down to chance.\n\nEDIT: I will also add, it's a lot easier to press submit on 200+ applications than perhaps this took. But simultaneously, it's a lot better on the ego for this approach than getting rejected 20 times (or 200 times, if you extend my experience by a factor of 10).",

What’s far more likely is AI chipping away at white-collar subtasks, with autocomplete-style models quietly handling bits and pieces instead of replacing entire professions. That means no sudden revolution, just a slow grind like the rollout of computers and the internet, where real value only appeared after years of messy engineering and integration. Along the way, demand for some jobs may shrink (though not vanish), making competition tougher without wiping whole careers out.\n\nAnyone else tired of the endless hype cycle? 😵",

      "title": "Born into poverty has been amazing for my finances",
      "selftext": "I was born in to real poverty in the very early 80s in Brighton. \n\n\nloads of times were we would be without electric, gas and food. I had a VERY poor childhood. My mother was a single mum with 3 kids and my mum was EXTREMELY poor with money.\nBeing brought up like this was the best thing for my adult finances. My mum showed me EXACTLY what NOT to do and I learnt lessons she refused to learn.\n\nI set myself some unbreakable rules when I entered the work force which I’ve NEVER broken. Not even once. Yes I have bought stuff I really could I really shouldn’t have but it has always been well within my buffer zone.\n\n\nI studied the financial system and found it really easy to understand but never really set out to make much money from the finance system but saw how you can easily get it to work for you if you follow your own rules and not theirs.\n\nThese are the rules I set myself and they have done me quite well over the years. I’ve never really struggled with my finances and thought maybe sharing my story may help some people? Maybe? Maybe not?\nWell these are my rules that have helped me over the years in no real order. \n\n•\tRespect every pound you make. When spending it, it needs to show it’s value when it is being used. It is always easier to save money than make money.\n\n•\tAlways live like you’re poor at your core. This doesn’t mean you cannot have nice things. Just means that when you buy nice things make sure you can easily afford it and never over stretch yourself.\n\n•\tUnderstand your next wage is NEVER guaranteed so NEVER and I mean NEVER depend on one income source. Since my mid 20s I’ve always had at least two sources of income.\n\n•\tLive off a credit card. Spend their money not yours. I saw very early on the level of protection you get by spending on a credit card. So again, from my mid 20s I’ve lived off cashback/reward credit cards which I’ve always paid in full at the end of the month. If I’m buying something on the credit card, I have the money in the bank.\n\n•\tKeep your out goings to a minimum. Never have that mind set “well it’s just another £200 a month I can afford that” it never ends well. \n\n•\tUse 0% finance on anything big if it is being offered with no fees even if it is just an intro offer. Just pay it off towards the end of the intro offer. Remember you’re spending someone else’s money so why risk your own? Very handy when buying a car. \n\n•\tUnderstand the value of the pound you make today will always go down tomorrow but the prices of services and products will go up. (yeah somethings do go down sometimes but normally stuff will always go up on a longer enough timeline.\n\n•\tUnderstand that truly rich people don’t look rich. Spending money on trying to look rich is one of the most counterproductive things you can do on this list and the thing I struggled/struggle with the most. When I started making some money in my mid/late 20s I REALLY wanted everyone to know I had money after spending so much of my life poor. Lucky for me that I grounded myself and never fell into a trap of buying flashy things for the sake of them being flashy for too long to damage me in any real way. \n\n•\tBulk buying things when they are on offer and shopping around. No matter how much money I have I’m ALWAYS looking for ways for my pound to work for me. My tooth paste that has a 3 years shelf life has gone down to £1.50 from £3.50? I’m buying at least 2 years wroth... Yeah I have a lot of supplies of things stored in my house lol We rarely run out of things.\n\n•\tAlways know your income and outgoings to the penny. It never fails to shock me the amount of people in my life that still doesn’t know this information!!\n\n\nSo yeah this post has become much longer than I planned it and it is the very first time I’ve ever written them down. Following these rules have really helped me in my life. Keeping an eye on the housing/banking markets has saved me so much money to spotting trends.\n\nAs soon as I saw interest start to rise I locked in our mortgage rate for 10 years at 3.49%. I wanted to lock in it a bit sooner at 2.75% (we were on 2.25%) but our FA kept telling me to hold off because it was going to drop back down again and we would waste the early repayment charge (which was about 5k) Even at 3.49% our FA and the bank really didn’t want us to remortgage but I did it anyway against their advice!\n\nSo that is my story. I’m in a great place now with my finances. The family and I live a very comfortable life style. I’m a sole trader and wife works part time so we can spend lots of time with the kids.\nWe own our own 4 bed end terraced house in a nice area with a very manageable mortgage (less than 25% of our monthly income)\n\nWe can go on nice holidays (not too flashy but nice). We drive what I call hidden flashy cars. My wife drives a newish Ford c max titanium x (which we got for an amazing price) and I drive a 12 year old Ford focus Sport which I’ve owned for 10 years.\n\nThe Cmax is an amazing car with all the fun toys and is lovely to drive but doesn't come with the cost of the “flashy car brand” tax. My car is still going strong because I look after it.\n\nI’m 40 and if anything happens to me I know that my family would be well taken care of.\n\nit has not been all smooth sailing, far from it but I do think following my rules on my money has really helped me in ways I can’t really put into words. I’ve tried to give advice to people because but they never followed it.\nI told my sister to lock in her rate on her mortgage when I did but she didn’t and is now looking at £500 extra a month :(\n\nSorry for the long post. Sorry for my poor grammar (im highly dyslexic) but if anyone wants to add to my post I’d love to hear your thoughts\n\neditted: lots of poor English, reddit app has no spell check. very bad for someone who is dyslexic lol\n\nEdit 2. Wow I never expected this post to go so crazy! When writing this it got nearly a million views! \n\n  \n\n95% of the comments have been great and I will reply to the DMs I promise. \n\n  \n\nGot a few personal attacks which is fine, it is the risk you take when you post anything onto the internet and some of you have made some great points that have worked for you.  \n\nNot once did I tell people to follow the rules, I set myself but said MAYBE they will help MAYBE they won’t but they did for me. \n\nThere is nothing special about me. I was kicked out of school at 14 with no exams and told by the system that I would make nothing of my life. Well I have. I’m extremely proud of myself and the amount of hard work I put into making sure that my family would not have to struggle. \n\nI see a few “you’re just lucky” posts. Yes you are correct, everything is down to luck. The next time you take a breathe is pure luck. \n\nThere are so many people struggling and MAYBE just MAYBE reading this post may help someone and going by the DMs and comments it will help. \n\nI stand by every word I have said in this sub, I don’t feed the trolls as I just find them funny! \n\nI really do wish the best for everyone reading this, I know times are hard but with work we can get on the other side of them. \n\nJust wanted to thank the mods, you have been amazing at keeping the post clean. You have done a great job at filtering the personal attacks. \n\nThis post was never really about me, it was about my story and I was hoping that passing on the knowledge I’ve gained could help others.  \n\nAt the end of the day, for me it is about personal responsibility and the willingness to make the hard choices to hit the goals I set myself.  \n\nWe are all different and that is a good thing. I wish you all the very best!",

      "title": "Guide to reducing your energy bills",
      "selftext": "I thought it might be useful to repost this [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/ykfuyb/guide_to_reducing_your_energy_bills/) on energy-saving tips, as although the winter months are now coming to an end, which means lower energy bills, it also means that this is the last month of the government's £400 energy grant.\n\nAs tariffs remain high, and with many people in the UK still needing to heat their homes well into the end of April/Early May, a lot of people will likely still struggle with energy costs.\n\nWith that said, and with the UK also experiencing a particularly cold spell of weather this week, here is a collection of ways to help reduce your energy bills:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**INTRO:**\n\nOne of the biggest ways in which people are overpaying for their energy bills is the unintentional, overuse of power. This is due to the fact that a surprisingly high amount of people don't know the 'kWh' of many household appliances, or how this number is calculated in the first place. So, let's start there:\n\nA Watt (W) is the unit of power by which electricity is measured. A Kilowatt (kW) is 1000 watts. So, one kilowatt hour (kWh) is the amount of energy you’d use if you kept a 1,000 watt (1kW)  appliance running for an hour. \n\nThis is the standard billing unit for energy providers, so a key part of reducing your household energy bills is to start putting a real money value on the kWh of your most used household appliances. So, with respect to this advice, here are a few ways to seriously save on your energy costs every month:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**HEATING THE HOME:**\n\n**PART ONE: THROW OUT THE FAN HEATER**\n\nMost of us are now paying around 34p per kWh, which means if an appliance has a rating of 1 kW, it costs 34p to keep it running for 1 hour.\n\nPut simply, humans need to stay warm when the weather is cold, this is probably the most obvious statement you'll read online today. However, what is less obvious to people is that the ways in which we choose to stay warm at home can mean the difference between paying £100-£200 more for your energy bills per month.\n\nI think for most people, it's obvious that some appliances cost more to run than others. However, I think the two main issues are that people don't think about the ways in which using more expensive appliances adds up over the course of 30 days, and also, common misconceptions about using certain electrical appliances to heat your home being cheaper than using the central heating.\n\nSo, going back to the title: A regular fan heater that you buy in Argos will use 1 kW, or 2kW if you have it on the second heat setting. This means that if your energy rate is 34p /kWh, you will pay 34p to keep this running for an hour at 1kW, or 68p to keep it running for an hour at 2kW (the second heat setting on most fan heaters).\n\nAn alarmingly high amount of people think that using a fan heater is cheaper than using the central heating, when in fact it can be up to 3 times more expensive than it would cost to power a radiator for an hour (Gas tariffs being around 10p/ kWh and assuming that a single radiator requires around 1.5kW to operate).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Looking at how this adds up over the course of a month:**\n\nUse of fan heater for 3 hours per day at 2kW = £2.04\n\nFor one week: £2.04 x 7 = £14.28\n\nFor 30 days: £2.04 x 30 = **£61.20**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a ridiculously high cost for a single appliance, especially considering that many people choose to have both the central heating on and use fan heaters to heat individual rooms at the same time.\n\nThis is where the alternatives come in, because as I said before, humans simply need to be warm when the weather is cold, **so** **it doesn't really matter how we achieve this, as long as we get it done.** With that being said, Here are some *much* cheaper ways to stay warm this winter:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Method**|**Cost To  Buy**|**Cost Per Hour (£/kWh)**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Electric Blanket|£15-£45|3p|\n|Hot Water Bottle|\\~£5|6p|\n|Heated Gilet|£13-£40|1p|\n|Heated Gloves|£5-£10|1p|\n|Footwarmer|£20-£40|3p|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ALSO:**\n\n**(1) Layer up.** Wear long sleeve thermals as your base layer, it goes a long way in conserving heat. They only cost around £6-8 and make such a difference.\n\n**(2) Use Extra Blankets:** If you find yourself at home during the day and feeling chilly, covering yourself in a blanket will often eliminate feeling the need to put the heating on.\n\n**(3) Go out for a walk:** Exercise helps warm us up. Bonus points if you go for a walk in the evenings when it's cooler, as you will appreciate the warmth inside your house more when you return.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PART 2: GETTING THE MOST OUT OF YOUR CENTRAL HEATING:**\n\nSo, when it comes to having the heating on in winter, the word 'inevitable' comes to mind. For this reason, It's crucial that you're getting the most out of your heating system. I think that 2 things, in particular, are essential in achieving this:\n\n**(1)** **EFFICIENCY**\n\nAs mentioned above, it's really important that people understand how the standard units of energy are measured, and how their bills are calculated, in order to think of the way we use our heating in terms of real money.\n\nGoing back to Watts, the standard unit of measurement for energy used by electrical appliances, it's important to note that 1 Watt = 1 Joule per second. So, 1kW = 1000 Joules per second.\n\nHeat energy is also measured in Joules, so from here we can see why our gas tariffs are given in kWh, since the amount of heat energy we use in Joules can easily be converted to kW.\n\nI know, this is starting to get a bit thermal physicsy, but bear with me...\n\nOnce we realise that it requires more kW of energy to heat the water in our boilers to a higher temperature, it becomes apparent that if we were to lower the 'flow temperature' of our boilers (This is the temperature that the water is heated to in our boilers before it is sent off to the radiators in our homes) then this will require less energy, and ostensibly allow our boilers to operate more efficiently, and at a lower cost. Here's how:\n\nThe most common type of boiler in the UK is known as a condensing boiler, since 2005, all boilers installed in the UK must be this type of boiler by law.\n\nCondensing boilers are very clever, in that they recycle the latent heat energy from water vapors that would have been lost through the flue (a pipe that carries exhaust gases produced by a boiler outside the home and releases it into the atmosphere) in older boilers.\n\nIn order for these boilers to work closer to maximum efficiency, most energy companies recommend setting your flow temperature to around 60 degrees, with some even recommending this setting be as low as 50 degrees, if you have a newer home.\n\nThe thing is, **many people in the UK have this setting very high**, often around 80 degrees or so, and not only can it end up costing you more money to operate your boiler at this high setting, it also compromises the efficiency of the boiler.\n\nThe reason for this is that condensing boilers need to be able to, well, condense. The 'return temperature' (the temperature of the water when it returns to the boiler) plays a big role in this, because only at lower temperatures can condensation occur. Condensation needs to occur because when water vapor changes phase from vapor to liquid, the latent heat ( the heat energy required for the phase change to occur in the first place) is returned to the system. This heat energy being recycled means that less 'new energy' is needed to heat up the water in the system (See? Very clever).\n\nThe maximum temperature before condensing will no longer occur is known as the dew point, and is usually around 55 degrees. If your flow temperature is around 60 degrees, then your return temperature should be around 40 degrees, which will allow the process of condensation to occur and increase the efficiency of the system.\n\n**In Summary:** A lower flow temperature can increase the efficiency of your heating system and help save you money.\n\n**NOTE:** Although condensing boilers are the most common type in the UK, there are many different boiler manufacturers. Before you decide to adjust your flow temperature, consult the manual of the make and model of your boiler to be sure you are adjusting the correct setting. There should be two temperature settings on your condensing combi boiler, one is for adjusting the flow temperature and the other is for adjusting the hot water temperature (the temperature of the water that comes out of your taps). It's also a good idea to research this topic yourself, as your home/heating system may benefit from different settings than others.\n\n**NOTE 2:** If you have a boiler and a hot water cylinder, then you should **not** reduce the flow temperature, because unlike combi boilers, these boilers only have one temperature setting for both hot water and heating. This is important because the water in the hot water tank needs to be kept at at least 60 degrees in order to prevent the danger of legionella bacteria.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(2) HEAT CONSERVATION:**\n\nAs important as having your heating system running efficiently, is conserving as much of the produced heat as possible. There is a number of things you can do to achieve this, Here's how:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(1) Stop covering your radiators.** It may sound obvious, but so many of us do it. The worst offender is probably having closed curtains covering the top of your radiator, essentially ensuring that the hot air rises up and goes straight to the cold windows. Not good.\n\nYou also don't want furniture blocking the radiators, even though a lot of heat is given out the top, you still want the heat from the front of the radiator to be able to go out into the room.\n\nDrying clothes/towels on the rad? Not such a good idea. I'm not going to say that this 'blocks' the heat coming out of the radiators exactly, because heat transfer is more complicated than that, but if you cover an entire radiator with a wet towel, for example, you'll notice that the room is  a lot slower to heat up. A good way to dry your clothes faster indoors is by placing a dehumidifier next to the clothes horse, it works a treat.\n\n**(2) Draught Proof your windows:** This one sounds like a big job but it's actually very easy to do and can make such a difference. All you need to do is apply self-adhesive foam tape to a window frame. Draughts also occur in cracks between the window frames and the surrounding walls – it’s worth considering using sealant or putty in these.\n\n**(3) Use Draught Excluders:** Having a draught excluder for your front/back door will not only make your home feel warmer as less heat escapes and less cold air is let in, but can also help reduce heating costs.\n\n**(4) Keep doors closed:** Leaving doors open is the fastest way to allow heat to escape from a room. Be sure to keep doors shut in order to keep the rooms you are spending your time in warmer and cosier for longer.\n\n**(5) Thermal-lined curtains:** These are heavier curtains that help keep the heat in your rooms for longer and can certainly be a worthwhile investment for your sitting room or bedroom.\n\n**(6) Fill in the gaps in wood flooring/ Use large rugs:** You may notice that cold air comes up through the gaps in your wood flooring, so a worthwhile way to prevent this from happening is to fill in these gaps using some. floorboard gap filler. However, if you don't want to go to the trouble of doing that, using large rugs to cover your wooden floors can also be very effective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**OTHER ENERGY COSTS:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(1) SHOWERS:**\n\nThe average electric shower in the UK operates at about 10kW. This means that a 6-minute shower uses about 34p of energy. Most people shower once per day, and in houses with 3 or 4 people, this cost can really start to add up.\n\nIn the winter, people will often spend longer in the shower because it's a nice way to warm up. However, this can also lead to people taking 10 or 15-minute showers, which can double or even triple the amount you're spending to operate this appliance every month.\n\nShortening your shower times can save you £100s over the course of a year, but on a monthly basis here are some comparisons for thought:\n\nSingle person who takes a 6-minute shower (34p approx) every day of the month: 34p x 30 = **£10.20**\n\nSingle person who takes a 15-minute shower (85p approx) every day of the month: 85p x 30 = **£25.50**\n\nHousehold of 4 people who each take a 6-minute shower daily: 34p x 4 x 30 = **£40.80**\n\nHousehold of 4 people who each take a 15-minute shower daily: 85p  x 4 x 30 = **£102**\n\nAs you can see, the extra time you spend in the shower can lead to a sizeable difference in your energy bills at the end of the month. I know, the thought of cutting down shower times is a bit grim, but it's still good to know that it's a potential way to reduce your energy bills this winter if you wish to do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(2) WASHING AND DRYING:**\n\nWashing Machines can be anywhere between 0.7-3 kW. Meaning the amount it costs to operate one per hour can vary depending quite a bit depending on the efficiency of the machine.\n\nA 0.7 kW machine should cost about **24p** to operate for an hour. Whereas a 3 kW machine will cost around **£1.02** to operate for the same amount of time.\n\nYou can easily check the kWh of your machine so that you have a better idea of how much energy it's using, but no matter what the hourly cost is, here are a couple of things you can do to reduce the amount you're spending on washing every month:\n\n**(1) Use the Quick Wash Setting:** This is my go-to cycle on the washing machine ever since energy bill armageddon. On most washing machines, it's a 20-minute cycle, and honestly, if it's just clothing that you've worn once and then thrown in the wash basket, you really don't need more than 20 minutes for a wash cycle. Of course, for stained or more odorous laundry, you can use a longer wash time, but for most washes that you put on, the 20-minute cycle more than does the job. Doing this can reduce your washing costs quite a bit, so it's absolutely worth changing to.\n\n**NOTE:** Some people are saying that washing your clothes on eco mode will use less energy even though the cycle lasts longer. This should be the case when compared with a regular cycle, but compared to the quick wash setting, at least on my machine, it does not. Only way to be sure is to check the manual of the washing machine you own and see how many kW each cycle uses.\n\n**(2) Reduce the temperature you wash your clothes at:** Washing clothes at 30 degrees instead of 40 degrees reduces the energy used per wash. This can help reduce the cost of your energy bills monthly and annually and it's a really simple adjustment to make.\n\n**(3) Fill your Machine:** It's a simple one, but ensuring that your washing machine is full means you'll put on fewer washes which in turn reduces the amount your machine is costing you every month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**DRYING:**\n\nMost tumble dryers operate at around 3kW, but some use even more energy than that. This means that they cost around £1-£1.50 per hour to operate. My solution to reducing the cost of these machines....is simply not to use them. Invest in a couple of clothes horses and dry your clothes near a  window. In colder months, a good way to dry your clothes faster indoors is by placing a dehumidifier next to the clothes horse, it works really well. You could easily save £20+ per month by ditching the tumble dryer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(3) COOKING:**\n\nMost household ovens operate at around 2kW, which means they would cost around **68p** per hour to power when running at full tilt (though in reality, they should actually cost a bit less than this, as they don't need to be heated up for the full hour that they're in use). Comparatively, A microwave usually operates at around 1kW, and an air fryer also operates at around 1kW or even a bit less than that, which means they cost around **34p** per hour to run.\n\nFor quick meals, there's an obvious advantage to using a microwave over the oven when possible, but when it comes to cooking things like, chips, meat, vegetables etc, using an air fryer can be a very advantageous alternative. Not only is the kWh half of that of an oven, which means half the energy cost, It also cooks food much faster than an oven, so it is more energy efficient on two fronts.\n\nYou could save £20-£30 per month by investing in an air fryer, which really adds up in the long run.\n\n**Also:** If you are cooking frozen food like pizza, chips etc. in the oven, there really is no need to preheat the oven for 5-10 minutes before throwing them in, It's a waste of energy. Just turn on the oven and put them in straight away, it will save both your energy and your time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**(4) BYE BYE TO STANDYBY**\n\nA UKPF user made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/wkxng0/energy_cost_of_devices_on_standby_in_my_home/) about how much electricity devices in his home were using while on standby. It's pretty eye-opening stuff and definitely worth a look.\n\nMy advice in relation to this is to simply try to get into the habit of completely switching off devices in the home when you're not using them. It's quick to do and easily done and could end up saving you quite a bit in the long run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's all that I can think of for now, if you have any other suggestions about how to save on energy in the home, please comment and I'll add it into this post.\n\nCheers",

      "selftext": "My partner and I have been together for 3 years and today we exchanged on our first house! When we met we were both in debt (only small amounts, £500 overdraft for me and around 1.5k on credit card for him), have both taken pay cuts and I've started a v expensive MSc and still, in 3 years we've saved a £30k deposit and paid for a wedding.\n\nHowever, we've had to make sacrifices. Here's how we did it. \n\nHis wage is around £30k, mine is £14k-£19k (I have a zero our contract and sometimes only work 24 hours instead of 36 due to my course, I'm paid minimum wage) \n\n•Our wedding was only £6k and we did have some parents help with about half. We kept it to the registry office and just drinks with dinner by ourselves in the evening.\n\n•We've never been on holiday abroad. We camp or Airbnb and tend to do lots of Groupon hotel weekends rather than whole weeks off. \n\n•We cut each others hair. (Yep, even for our wedding, he cut my hair 😂) I guess I'm lucky that I don't really enjoy having my nails done or hair done so that does help! \n\n•We've always lived with housemates to keep the rent down and our savings high. Which at 31 and 35 is nuts but there's no other way we could have saved in Bristol with rent prices. \n\n•We live in Bristol and have not been able to buy here, we've gone towards Worcester to find something more affordable but also better for us long term (not a city, nicer community for family)\n\n•We meal plan meticulously, try &amp; only eat meat once or twice a week and buy meat from the reduced section to keep in the freezer to make a plan with later. We used to use OLIO a fair bit but it hasn't been so useful recently. We shop in ALDI. We freeze leftovers so we have meals on weeks where we need to do a smaller shop. \n\n•We have a nice coffee machine to have coffees at home rather than out. \n\n•We used the LISA and maxed that out over the 3 years. We were saving during lockdown so it helped. \n\n•We share 1 car (he works from home, again very lucky that it works for us) \n\n•We use Monzo pots to put small amounts aside each month for car payments, holidays, meals out so we do those things when we have the money there rather than the other way around. We know when we're having a tight month we could still treat ourselves if we wanted to rather than using the credit card guiltily. \n\n•We only ever buy things second hand - Vinted for clothes, Facebook marketplace for household items and we tend to sell things when we can too. I don't think we've ever been shopping together in a mall or shopping centre 😂\n\nWriting this out sounds like a slog but it hasn't been! We just track everything we spend. The frequent weekends means it feels like we get lots of holidays, and we eat out regularly, get takeaways regularly, go to the theatre or cinema often. But we have worked hard and I'm very proud of us and I would really like to go to Italy now 😂😂😂\n\nEdit: we bought a house for £195k - deposit was 30k so we could still have some breathing room to live/save/overpay if we want.",

I've written this as a sort of lessons learned and next steps reflection to help me and thought I'd share it here to help others and get suggestions. Anything else you'd suggest? (I am based in London)\n\nThese were the cards taken:\n\nAmex (physical and app)\nMonzo (app)\nNatWest (app)\nStarling (Card and App)\nVirgin money credit card (card and app)\nVodafone sim (important consideration)\n\nThey were unsuccessful at taking any money out of any of the accounts, although they did try. Having a different phone unlock code to pin numbers for my cards helped (I insisted they were the same as I didn't actually know the pin numbers to my cards as I'm so reliant on contactless/ mobile). \n\nWe often talk about best deals and saving money but do we always consider what happens in a worse case scenario? Will the bank or provider be responsive in crisis?\n\n1. I did not have a back up phone or landline at home so needed to rely on a neighbour. I will be changing this. \n\n\n2. I tried contacting family members with a very old email I could get access to but they all assumed my email had been hacked rather than I was actually robbed. One even sent a WhatsApp message which was received by the attackers with a screenshot of the email. I will set up a system with them with a word we can use.\n\n\n3. I had all my bank cards either on phone or in wallet. They all needed to be cancelled leaving me with no way to access money.  I will be changing this with a backup card unconnected to phone. \n\n\n4. None of my email addresses worked on my desktop without a OTP from my phone or a recovery code from one of the emails. I will be changing this. \n\n\n5. At 10pm I tried to cancel cards: Amex, starling and Vodafone were easy to deal with and answered the phone quickly and blocked my accounts and number. NatWest put me through to voicemail, virigin money picked up the phone but failed security because I didn't have the account number for direct debit (as it was on the phone which was stolen and I'm paperless and had no access to email). Monzo forced me to use the app and made it really difficult to talk to a human. When I did they failed to actually block the account. I was able to get through to NatWest the next day, I'm still dealing with Monzo. \n\n\nFour days later I have access to all accounts on a new phone except Virgin Money which can take up to 11 days (in 2023..)\n\n\n6. Everything hinged on my phone number. I had no money or way to use public transport so had to walk to the Vodafone store who gave me a free replacement SIM once I had proved identity. I put this in an old phone and got access to email addresses and accounts again. This then gave me access to banking via phone number and emails. I am grateful they had a brick and mortar store. \n\nNext steps:\n- stop using Monzo, it's not worth it their customer service is awful. \n- stop using virgin money once current credit card is settled, so many options not worth the hassle. \n- continue to keep a backup old mobile phone for redundancy. \n- get a landline \n- have alternate one time password solution than phone (emergency email address not linked to my phone)\n- have a emergency card not registered to mobile banking with a small fund to last a few days on.\n- continue to use a mobile provider with a physical store in walkable distance\n\n\nEdit \n\n\n- thanks for all your support and I'm pleased this has been so helpful!\n\n\n- I didnt intend the takeaway from this to be that London is somehow bad or dangerous. That hasn't been, and still isn't, my experience. I'd encourage you to continue to visit and live in this wonderful city, as I intend to!",

      "selftext": "Edit: thank you for the good vibes after something we felt very vulnerable in sharing. And thank you for the encouragement and for sharing your own experiences, knowing that other couples have been in our shoes and came out stronger is so reassuring. My girlfriend is over the moon with the support and nice words.\n\nThree months ago I[ posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1k8lto8/my_girlfriend_doesnt_know_how_much_debt_shes_in/) asking for some advice about my girlfriends debt.\n\nTo summarise, three months ago I realised my girlfriend not only was completely financially illiterate (e.g. she had no idea that paying a credit card was being in debt, she thought that was more like a big mortgage. I know...) but also she was in credit card debt and she didn't even know how much she owed as she was very ashamed and in denial. She had 5 credit cards (I was only aware of 2, not because she was hiding them but because they never came up in conversation) and was making minimum payments on all of them. Thanks to advice here, I signed her to ClearScore to check how much debt she was on: £8250, all in +30% interest cards.\n\nMy disappointment in her was her wake up call. I am extremely money savvy and I have the savings to cover her debt if needed. But I've works hard for it and I have made sacrifices so it would have seemed undair (she never asked me to, for the record).  She would also never learn that way so I told her I'd help her by teaching her about finances,  looking for better options to transfer the debt, etc., but the money sacrifice would have to be hers.\n\nWe started by creating a version of the budgeting spreadsheet I use for my finances, because she didn't know how much she spent on different things. At first I'd go through her bank account with her and tell her were to write every transaction, twice a week. After a while, she was doing it weekly by herself, while I updated my own spreadsheet (we call them \"financial meetings\", and we have a nice tea while doing it) After two months, we could see a pattern and tackle where the money goes. For example: she was suscribed to Prime, Netflix, Apple TV, Disney+, NowTV... And we basically only watch Disney (which I get free thanks to a Lloyds perk) and Netflix, so she cancelled everything else. \n\nShe's also transferred most of the debt to a 0% interest card (the debt with the highest interest), and stopped spending money on unnecessary things.\n\nAlso, I know that you're supposed to tackle the debt first before saving, but I wanted her to have a little satisfaction of watching her savings grow, which previously were 0, and getting her into the habit of saving money for her future. So every month, on payday, I recommended her to send money to her savings account (and LEAVING IT THERE), and pay for credit card debt, so she knows how much she has for the rest of the month. \n\nThere's also little tricks for unnecessary spending like she gave me all her credit cards so she can't use them, she deactivated GooglePay and contactless payment so she has to physically introduce the card and type the pin to buy (this slight inconvenience makes her more conscious of the money she's spending), etc...\n\n**The result?** In three months, not only her debt hasn't increased like it was the trend before, but it's gone down to £7000 (and considering she's low income right now, I'm extremely proud). She's put around 1700 into tackling her debt (although because only now we've managed to tranfser her debt to a 0% interest card, the high interests ate a lot of that) and her savings are £400.\n\nSeeing that if she wasn't in debt she would have £2100 right now makes her even more willing to clear this debt.\n\n\\----------------\n\nI just wanted to let people know, especially people with partners that seem a bit irresponsible with money, that change is possible, but they also need support and trust and patience. I'm extremely proud of her and she's in the path of clearing everything way before Christmas 2026, which is the goal I set for her.",

      "title": "Watching my Gen Z gf shop online has made me realize I’ve been lacking in so many areas",
      "selftext": "So I’m in my 30s and my current strategy for my Ecom brands was just to purely focus on ads and use generic content to try and push my products as much as possible.\n\nThis comes from my “direct response” mindset that I’ve grown up with due to working with offline media/ads and strictly FB for the past 7 years or so.\n\nBut the way my gf was shopping online made me realize how much of a dinosaur I’ve been in terms of my marketing strategy.\n\nI’m sure a lot of you already know how Gen z shops, but she would literally have both the Ecom website and TikTok open at the same time, and any time she saw a product she was even remotely interested in, she would search for the product on TikTok and just scroll through 10+ videos before making a decision.\n\nOnce she made a decision on what she wanted, she would bookmark the page and then tell me that she’s gonna buy it in a couple weeks when her budget allows.\n\nSo what does this mean for me, as a marketer?\n\nA few things:\n\n1. I need to focus more on organic content generation. I’ve been using all of my UGCs and my own content strictly for ads without even thinking about the organic/social side. I literally have IG and FB accounts with tens of thousands of followers and 0 posts (stupid, I know). So my goal now is to pump out as much content as possible showing the product off in every way, especially with addressing all concerns and objections a customer may have regarding the product.\n\n2. Rework my naming conventions. This one may seem like a non-issue, but from what I’ve seen, my gf literally searched the exact product name every time. This means if my naming conventions are too generic, it’s possible the search on TikTok may show results of my direct competitors (which I don’t necessarily want). \n\n3. Think with a long term, multi-touchpoint perspective. Gen z, and most people in general, struggle with their budgeting and finances. Which means the “direct response” approach, although still viable, isn’t the be-all, end-all that it used to be. I need to think of ways to address concerns with price points, offer more ways to pay (especially with buy now, pay later methods), and stay at the forefront of their minds for at least a few weeks to a few months so that when they are able to buy, I’ll be there ready.\n\nI know these things are very simple and almost no-brainer concepts, but I’ve been so caught up in my daily ROAS and ROI that I’ve completely neglected to think about how people actually buy nowadays, especially with my market being majorly Gen Z.\n\nAnyway, if anything, I hope you guys take this post as a wake up call to actually observe people in your market shop online. Not just through heat maps and tracking software, but literally sitting down beside them and watching what they do, even seeing the types of things they say to themselves to rationalize a (future) purchase.

      "title": "What I learnt from sourcing e-commerce products from China.",
      "selftext": "DISCLAIMER: The intention of this to increase cautiousness and practice best practices between the entrepreneurs that are importing from China. \n\nSo I have been running an e-commerce store for a very long time, not a drop-shipping particularly but we would order the products in bulk to the country and then ship from there (For faster shipping).I wanted to do drop-shipping but then it halted back in 2019, right after the COVID and ePacket was banned &gt;!(ePacket is a shipping agreement between US and China to reduce shipping times, it uses passenger planes to carry the parcel, hence faster shipping)!&lt;.\n\nAnyway getting back to the point, We were selling jewellery in the United States, firstly we used to just order from Aliexpress (a bunch of 500 every week) to our warehouse, do the quality check and then we would ship it from there. However the price per item was $7.80 and it was selling for $25.99 with a good profit margin.\n\nWe decided to scale that store (I shared the scaling strategy in a different blog post) by going to a supplier and ordering 10K since Q4 was coming up and we were trying to scale up, the item was selling like a hot dog. We posted a few Request For Quotation on Alibaba and got some quotations and here are my learnings.\n\n* **You will get the same product for less.**\n\nThe item we were getting for $7.80 was available for as low as $4.00 if we ordered in bulk, and as high as $10, so it varies. If you order $10K units then it will be available for $2.00. The more volume you ask for the lesser the cost will be - I mean it's normal, but the cost can go very low. I mean compare $7.80 to $2.00\n\n* **You will have to do your own quality check.**\n\nAlibaba is not like Amazon where they do the quality check for you, you will have to do your quality check before you ship the items to your customers. We ordered 10K and got around 300 defective items from the supply. (either they were broken, or of a bad quality). And then you have to send them to the supplier, the supplier will usually ask you to send the items back but it's not worth the time. So make sure that you order at least 10% more of what you need.\n\n* **Plan your shipments accordingly and choose the correct method**\n\nUnrelated to the store, we saw a great kitchen product that we thought could do really good in the American market, but the problem? It was 1.2Kgs. It was a really large item made out of stainless steel. We wanted it faster but AIR CARGO was expensive (it was charging $2000) as we did not have time since Q4 was already around the corner, however the affordable option was ship containers but the transit time was 1 month. So make sure if you plan to order large items, do it beforehand and make sure you choose the right shipping service to save costs.\n\n* **Trust your negotiation skills.**\n\nYou got to trust your negotiations skills and don't be shy when negotiating with your suppliers, we got down the per product cost from $6 to $4.80. While it may not seem a lot but it saved around $3500 per order. So negotiation works! I mean just like any other business.\n\n* **Never ditch a supplier too early.**\n\nIf you find a better price somewhere then don't move your orders at once, we got a supplier that was giving the exact same product for almost 20% less, and ordered 500 units from them. Most of the units were defective, so always maintain multiple suppliers until you do the quality check of both of the suppliers.\n\n* **Have multiple modes of communication**\n\nIf you're using Alibaba chat to communicate with your suppliers then make sure you have their emails and WhatsApp, WeChat or anything they use because they will go offline without prior notice.\n\n* **You will get free FedEX/UPS shipping**\n\nDon't hesitate to ask for premium shipping if you maintain a good relationship, the supplier we had used to send the items using ePacket which used to take 10-14 days, talked to the supplier and he offered a premium FedEX shipping for large orders which delivered the order in 4-5 days max (to California)\n\n* **Always use AliBaba Payment Gateway**\n\nNever use PayPal, or WeChat or anything else to send the funds, it's just not worth the hassle. Even though you have the escrow services at place. I would just avoid PayPal or anything and just go with Alibaba's gateway. It is seamless and has a great grievance redressal system.\n\n* **Product Sourcing Agents are great but be careful**\n\nThere are a lot of product sourcing agents are great, they will get in touch directly with the manufacturer for you and can get any type of customisation done for you and can get you better prices. But be careful and use a better sourcing agent.\n\nI guess that was it. I will edit this post if I find more points to address.",

      "selftext": "So this is embarrassing to admit, but here goes. We run a DTC fashion brand (won't name it for obvious reasons). Last year we raised a seed round and decided to \"do things right\" for once. That meant hiring a proper photographer, booking models, renting a studio, the whole professional setup. Total spend was $12,347 for one collection (about 40 pieces).\n\nWe A/B tested the new \"professional\" photos against our old ghetto setup where we literally just hung clothes on hangers against a white wall and photographed them with an iPhone.\n\n\\- Old setup (iPhone + white wall): 3.2% conversion rate\n\n\\- New setup ($12K professional): 2.7% conversion rate\n\nWe lost 15% of our conversion rate after spending five figures. And after some very intense discussions we've identified 3 reasons for this happening:\n\n1. The professional shots were too polished. They didn't look real. They looked like ads, so people's brains just... ignored them.\n\n2. The models were too perfect. Our customers couldn't relate. They wanted to see what the clothes actually looked like on normal people.\n\n3. Lighting was too perfect. Made the fabric look different than it actually was. We got more returns.\n\nThe iPhone shots were scrappy, but they were real. You could see the actual texture of the fabric. The lighting showed the true color. No deceptive angles (which is the most important factor in ecom). We can't even reuse most of those $12K photos because they're seasonal. So that money is just... gone. Now we're stuck between wanting professional looking visuals (because we're trying to raise a Series A and need to look legit) and knowing that our scrappy setup actually converts better. Any ideas about the path forward?",

From small optimizations to complete website rebuilds to buying expensive CROs from experts. I bet there is nothing you can think of that I haven't tried. \n\nSure, all of this did help me a little bit with my conversions, but it didn't bring me back anywhere close to where I once was. \n\nThen this morning I had the randomest urge to go through all my orders one by one. I noticed something interesting - at least a third of all orders, if not half, had multiple payment attempts. And most abandoned checkouts had failed payment attempts. My Stripe account allows me to see why these transactions didn't go through, and nearly ALL of them failed due to insufficient funds.\n\n(I sell a relatively higher ticket item so this may not be the case for you.)\n\nThis was an eye opening moment. I felt bad for the world, man. We spend all our time trying to squeeze as much money as possible out of our customers, when many of them are literally giving us their last dollars. Maybe they have really stressful lives and retail therapy provides them some relief and distraction.\n\nAs a result of this new insight, I am going to focus less on my conversion rate and more on taking better care of my existing customers. \n\nThank you for reading.",

Nobody needs your product unless you are water, nutrients or shelter. People will buy from your company because they trust you, see some value and most of all LIKE you or your company.\n\nI'm an idiot but miraculously had the stroke of insight to stop automating emails and begin personally emailing customers about 1.5 years ago and the conversion rate has skyrocketed. We would have like 8 abandon carts a day and I was sending automated emails. Why? Now, especially for sales emails to past customers I include a personal note from me the founder, I mention something about a newsworthy event, I use their name if it's obvious in the email address or mention a sports team based on their address if I have it.\n\nImagine the difference between these two emails:\n\n\\---\n\n1. Hi! We noticed you bought last year, need any \\_\\_\\_\\_, can we help with anything?\n\nvs.\n\n2) Hi Steve! We're not nominated for an Oscar tonight but we still have great \\_\\_\\_. I just wanted to check in and see if you enjoyed the \\_\\_\\_\\_. We're offering 10% off to past customers because we loved them and really want Michigan to beat Ohio State this weekend.\n\nI'm the founder if you need anything or want to tear apart the product so I can learn.\n\n\\---\n\nThat's the difference of about a 4x increase in conversion rate.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIf you are sitting there thinking you don't have time for this, you are in business and nothing drives your business forward like sales. I guarantee if you write 10 cold emails right now to past customers that are genuine you will drive 1 sale or at least receive scathing feedback about how to improve your product. Not selling your product causes more stress and pain and frustration than anything else.\n\nSTOP AUTOMATING EVERYTHING, YOU DON'T EVEN DO 50K IN SALES A YEAR.\n\nPS: Newsletters are great for valuable content, send some hot sauce recommendations or link to a blog post you wrote but PERSONALLY write the APE emails (Abandon Carts, Pop-Up Captures &amp; Expired CC Cards)\n\nIf you don't agree, COME AT ME BRO!",

DM is easiest as just google \\[Author Name\\] instagram or twitter will produce their social accounts. For email you can either guess or if you have any email from the news outlet they all use the same format ie [First.Last@nbcuni.com](mailto:First.Last@nbcuni.com)\n3. KEEP YOUR EMAIL TO ONE SENTENCE - One sentence, the email has to be brief and appear handwritten or you are dead on arrival. I write the same thing \"Saw your post on \\_\\_\\_ sending a tip for any Valentine's Day Gift Guides! If included I'll have the social team re-share it!\n4. Offer to re-share it - Writer are in the eyeballs game and if you have any type of following it's just more traffic which will make them look good.\n5. SELF DEPRECATING SUBJECT LINE - The #1 most effective subject line we have ever used by far is \"Mediocre Gift For Him\", we then add Christmas, Father's Day, Valentine's Day, Grilling ect. like \"Mediocre Christmas Gift For Him\"  - Nobody likes sale-sy stuff and it makes you seem human.\n6. FOLLOW UP - People don't do this, if you don't get a reply write these words and hit send \"Following up!\" - That's it. 50% + of opportunities happen on the follow up.\n\nThis is not a slow and steady thing. Book off 1 day every 3 months, drink a tonne of coffee and reach out to as many people as possible in 10 hours, follow up 3 days later and forget about it.  I watch motivational movies in the background while I do it to stay sane.\n\nPS: Focus on the Big Dogs! One appearance on the today show drove 24K in a day! Your product is good enough I promise.  News needs to talk about the new things constantly.\n\nThank you!",

      "selftext": "I've personally set up email flows for at least 50 brands. I am going to share how I set up email automation for brands that do 30k-150k per month. Brands doing less than 30k a month often don't need all of these emails, they can focus on abandoned cart, welcome series and browse abonnement. Brands doing more than 150k a month will need more in-depth flow work but I can expand on that in another post.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n**Welcome Series** **(6-10 emails)**\n\n\n\n1. Thanks for signing up\n2. Discount reminder\n3. Welcome to the family (buyers)\n4. Join our rewards point program (If applicable) (buyers)\n5. Learn about the brand (non-buyers)\n6. Social proof + Follow us on social (non-buyers)\n7. Last Chance to use gift (non-buyers)\n8. Discount reminder (non-buyers)\n\n**Post Purchase (Broken into multiple flows)**\n\n\n\n1. Thanks &amp; welcome to the brand (1x)\n2. Gift as a token of appreciation(1x)\n3. Gift Reminder(1x)\n4. Congratulate them on their decision to buy again + show appreciation (2x)\n5. Gift Reminder (if applicable) (2x)\n6. Review Request (2x)\n7. VIP STATUS Achieved (3x)\n8. Gift Reminder (if applicable) (3x)\n9. Referral/Points/Ambassador Program (if applicable) (3x)\n\n**Browse Abandonment (3-5 Emails)**\n\n\n\n1. Saw something you liked?\n2. Still interested?\n3. Social Proof + Possible Discount\n4. Discount Reminder (If applicable)\n\n**Abandoned Cart (5-8 emails) (custom abandon cart flows for specific products if necessary)**\n\n\n\n1. Looks like you left this behind\n2. Still interested?\n3. Stock running low\n4. Social proof\n5. Educational emails about why customers should buy from you (If applicable)\n6. Discount\n7. Reminder\n\n**Sunset Flow (2-3 Emails)**\n\n\n\n1. Ask unengaged subscribers if they are still interested\n2. Final opt out opportunity\n\n**Customer Winback (3-5 emails)**\n\n\n\n1. Check out what’s new\n2. Showcase positive recent customer buying experience\n3. Discount\n4. Reminder\n\n**Customer Review**\n\n\n\n1. Offer discount for review\n2. Discount delivery + customer appreciation\n\n**Special Flows**\n\n\n\n1. Cross Sell (Used when you have a common upsell with one of your hot products)\n2. Affiliate Program flow (used if you have ambassador or affiliate programs setup)\n3. Rewards point flow (breaks down and encourages reward points systems such as smile io)\n4. Replenishment reminder (for stores with consumable products)\n\nThis is relatively simple work, but it is time-consuming and will probably take at least a few days to complete. But no need to worry, you don't have to go all out. Simply turning on some of the Klaviyo default flows and editing them so that they're onbrand will easily boost your revenue by at least 5%. Dont be discouraged to dedicate a couple days into your back-end automated marketing. These sales add up, the earlier you set these emails up, the more money you'll make in the long run.",

      "selftext": "Before I get into the good parts of this post here's a quick disclaimer:\n\n\\- This brand did 1.8 million the year before\n\n\\- I do not own this brand, I was hired to build a cult-following\n\n\\- paid ads were being ran for the first quarter of the year but not converting well\n\nThat's relevant information because not every brand can see massive success without paid ads.  Most of the things I talk about in this post are pretty much useless if you do under 15k/month. Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about what I did to nearly double this brand's revenue without dumping more money into ads.\n\n**For those who don't like reading, I'll summarize what I did right here: I built a community around the brand.**\n\nSo I'll break down what I did into 5 steps:\n\n*1. Obtained a shit load of user-generated content*\n\nI was able to get 300 videos of people using the brand's products in under 60 days.\n\nThis is easier than it seems. People pay influencers thousands to pose with their products. For a brand with a bit of traction, the value in user-generated content is to get products in front of a larger audience; Not necessarily for social proof (like it is for smaller brands).  So with that being said, don't spend a lot of money on UGC content unless it's for a promotional post on a page with a large following.\n\nDon't fixate on having the prettiest videos. Give a wide variety of people the opportunity to submit content.\n\n3 ways you can get user-generated content for free/cheap are.\n\n\\- Use your social media channels to offer a free product in exchange for a video review\n\n\\- Setup a review email flow, offer existing customers a chance at a full refund for a video testimonial that meets certain criteria\n\n\\- Directly contact influencers and negotiate/hire someone with a network of influencers to do the negotiation process for you\n\n*2. Created a blog*\n\nI designed a blog page on the website and posted on it 1-2 times per week. I used Ai to generate in-season ideas for blog posts, then got my copywriter to do some research and come up with short blog posts that were informative and read well. P.S just using chatgpt to pump out blog content can work but the content will never be as engaging as content written by a real person that understands the marketing angle. We also tried to add user-generated content on the blog pages as much as we could.\n\nThis is by far the easiest way to get people back onto your site without them feeling like you're trying to sell them more products. This is the base of the next 3 steps. Good blog content makes people in your niche excited to hear from you. This will boost your email open rates, allow you to post in groups that are heavily moderated against promotions, and give you a lot of niche-specific copywriting to work with.\n\n*3. Created a subreddit (or any type of group)*\n\nI created a subreddit for this brand, then I spent hours finding niche-relevant content. Then, I queued a whole bunch of posts. I did a mix of reposting content from tiktok, instagram, youtube, etc, and posting the site's blog posts and UGC content. Growing the community was tricky but once I got some momentum going it was almost growing itself.  \n\nThere's major upside to owning a community inside of your niche. You can block your competitors from posting in your sub and post as much promotional content as you want. You can also mix content, so people have no idea if you're promoting a store, sharing a funny photo, or giving a useful recommendation. You'd honestly be shocked by the amount of traffic our weekly pinned post brought to the site.\n\n*4. Discord community*\n\nI used social media, Reddit, and emails to grow the community to 11 thousand members in under a year.  Customers were giving design ideas, connecting with store employees, and volunteering to send content with products for FREE. \n\nThis is like a reddit community but more personal. The main difference between the discord and the reddit is that the discord is branded and the Reddit is just niche specific. This is a good place to run competitions and polls, and also just interact with customers on a personal level. You can get a tone of UGC from a discord community if you use it right.\n\n*5. Email and SMS marketing*\n\nI saved the best for last. Normally my posts are mainly focused on emails but I thought I'd switch it up today to truly convey what goes on behind the scenes of well-coordinated email/sms marketing.\n\nThink of emails as an ongoing conversation between you and your customer. You play the role of a friend recommending things to a peer. You already know things about them, like their interests, location, and buying habits. Now use segmentation and predictive analytics to make sure relevant content gets sent to interested people. I'll leave it at that.\n\nBut before I leave  I'll share some more info about this brand that may be relevant. It's a breed-specific animal brand,  this brand has been around for about 4 years and has consistently grown 30-40% each year with last year being an outlier (almost doubled sales), the people in this niche are extremely passionate about their pets so this may have made it easier for me to grow a community this quickly, and the 2.5 million that I am attributing to my systems are just the sales that came from EMAIL and SMS marketing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks so much for taking the time to read my post, Id be happy to provide more clarity on any of the subjects that I mentioned in this post.",

      "selftext": "At the beginning of this year, my Shopify store went from $2k to $10k in just 3 weeks. I was hyped cause it finally felt like things were working.\n\nSo I pushed ad spend and kept going, expecting cash to follow. But I didn’t realize how quickly it could dry up.. Between delayed payouts, daily ad spend, and more unexpected refunds, I had less than $1,000 in my bank account just 2 weeks later. So basically sales was great but somehow I was broke.\n\nThankfully I was able to borrow money from my parents to keep my store going.\n\nThat’s when I realized just looking at monthly, traditional financial statements isn't enough. You need to map out your cash week by week and actually forecast what’s coming in and going out.\n\nHere’s what I’ve been doing since then so I don’t have to go through that again:\n\n1. Using 13-week CF forecast model\n\nSo I learned that financial statements aren’t all that helpful when you’re dealing with serious cash issues. For me, what actually helped was setting up a 13-week cash flow forecast model. \n\nWhy 13? Cause that feels manageable, not too far out, but enough to see when things might get tight. You can go beyond that to 26 weeks if you want, but 13 is more than enough and most accurate for most of us.\n\n2. Planning for different cash flow scenarios\n\nOnce I had the 13-week forecast set up, the next step was using it to plan ahead and avoid getting caught off guard.\n\na. For big decisions\n\nI run three versions of the forecast:\n\n* A best-case version where things slightly outperform (110% of expectations)\n* A base-case (100% of expectations)\n* And a worst-case with a drop in revenue or spike in costs (70% of expectations)\n\nThis helps me stay grounded and not build my entire month around everything going perfectly.\n\nb. For monthly what-ifs\n\nEach month, I tweak a few key assumptions to see how much room I really have. Things like:\n\n* What if product cost goes up 10% next month?\n* What if I push a payout back by 2 weeks?\n* What if I reallocate part of my Meta budget to TikTok and it underperforms?\n\nc. For quarterly stress test\n\nEvery quarter, I run through a few worst-case situations. Stuff like:\n\n* Revenue suddenly dropping 40%\n* Ad costs doubling overnight\n* My supplier going quiet for 30–60 days\n\nThese aren’t fun to look at, but they help me figure out how long I could last if things go south.\n\nNow I’m sitting at about $10k to $15k per month. I know that’s not a crazy number, but it feels a lot more stable now that I actually understand my cash flow and I don’t wake up stressed about whether I can cover next bills.\n\nI’m still trying to get better at planning ahead and making smarter decisions. If you’ve got your own way of managing cash or finances in general, I’d love to hear what you do.",

      "selftext": "I've been running a Food Subscription Box for 10+ years and SUCK at paid ads so I test a lot of ways to find new customers. One thing I never cracked for years was referral programs.  I signed up for a couple apps that did the whole \"refer a fried and get 15% off\" thing but it never really did anything.  That's when I stumbled on this double edge solution, hopefully it works for you.\n\nALL I DO is reach out to any customer who has been subscribed for 1 year and write this exact email:\n\n\\---\n\nHi \\_\\_\\_,\n\nI'm a founder, thank you for being a subscriber for a year, if there is anyone you know who would love \\[Your Company\\], I would be happy to send them a \\[Your Product\\] (on us of course).\n\n\\---\n\nThat's it. The Result:\n\n1. A massive flow of new subscribers (we add an insert into the free box with a 10% off coupon too).\n2. It makes existing loyal subscribers feel acknowledged and improves our churn rate (acts as a loyalty program).\n3. The only cost is the cost of one box but the perceived value is $85.\n4. The email opens a dialogue with existing customers where they can mention feedback or any issues etc.\n\n\\*\\*Note\\*\\* - A very important line is \"if there is anyone you know who would LOVE  \\[Your Company\\]\" It really makes them think of who would ENJOY the service so it's a scorching hot lead.\n\nIT IS INSANE HOW SIMPLE THIS IS - I don't know anyone else that does this as a \"referral program\" and it is so easy and effective.  It took me about 6 years to figure it out so try it!\n\nWorst case scenario, your existing customer is happy, best case you get a new customer. No SAS costs, widgets, code or anything.

      "title": "10 hard truths about UX",
      "selftext": "Been in UX for ~15 years now. Worked everywhere from startups to global design firms to tech (where I've spent the last 8 years). I see a lot of posts about similar things, and I wanted to share some truths that I've come to know:\n\n1. **There are no silver bullets**. There's no one magic right way to get stakeholders to care about your work—or to get you in the room. There's nothing unique or special that goes into a case study or folio. And there's no simple fix for any design problem. All these things take hard work, grit, patience and humility.\n\n2. **Being nice, easy to work with and reliable is more important than genius**. A kind and competent designer &gt; curmudgeonly genius. This means you should never pick a fight with a senior stakeholder or partner over what you think is right. They won't see it as passion; they'll see it as arrogance. Besides, if your work is brilliant but you're a grump, you probably won't get promoted—but if you deliver on time and are easy to work with (even if the work isn't mind-blowing), you'll rise fast. So—get the work done, and don't try to re-steer the ship.\n\n3. **Being a facilitator is more important than being an ideator**. Being able to bring people into the process, get their ideas, and guide a team to the best solution—whether it's your idea or not—is way more important than anything else. Great directors, managers and design leaders index on this rather than going into closed rooms and figuring it out.\n\n4. **Now may not be the time for your big idea**. We've all been in positions where we've pitched an idea only for someone to shoot it down. I get it, it's frustrating—and it's hard seeing a team move forward with a subpar solution. But be patient. Bide your time. Don't die on a hill trying to make people care in that moment. I guarantee that in 3, 6 or 12 months your idea will be needed—and it'll be ready to go because you'd already formulated it.\n\n5. **We're digital brick layers—not innovators**. A lot of us came into this field because we loved the idea of *making*. But in reality, we're handed a stack of bricks (a design system) and asked to construct something (a product) that's already been planned (by a product manager). Sure, we problem solve along the way, but we're not here to redefine business models. We're here to make the things within the appropriate timeframe.\n\n6. **Relax**. Careers are long, and it's just a job. I know you may think being laid off or getting a bad performance review is the end. But it's not. It never is. Process it, learn from it, and get back to work. It'll be fine.\n\n7. **Be humble and don't overthink**. Sometimes the simplest, most obvious solution is the best one. And sometimes that arrogant PM or executive will have the best answer. A huge difference between junior and senior is recognizing this.\n\n8. **See the forest for the trees**. Sometimes we get irked when we're told we can't build something, but we need to approach these moments with curiosity. Assume the best: *Maybe there's some new plan from the executive team that I don't know about?* And be curious. Get to know stakeholders, understand their goals and aspirations, and learn about the restrictions that frustrate them.\n\n9. **There's no such thing as The Design Process**. Every organization is different. Every product has its own quirks. Every one of us thinks about things differently. Be flexible, curious, and figure out how to work in all sorts of different environments (yes, that means making things without research sometimes!). Sure, there are commonalities, but the skill is in being flexible and figuring things out as you go—especially when the expected process breaks down (which it usually does).\n\n10. **The world sucks**. Design exercises are unethical, but in this market we have no choice but to do them. Layoffs are hard, but most of us will be there at some point. We're under-appreciated, but what's new? Bootcamps are basically con jobs, and even the glitziest folio may not get you an interview.",

      "title": "Just finished reviewing new grad portfolios and have advice",
      "selftext": "I work in big tech and recently finished reviewing portfolios for early career new college grads! I wanted to share some general tips from my experience. Please note that all companies are different and hiring might differ wildly so this is just one person’s advice from one company. \n\n* I passed 60% of portfolios\n* We are required to fill out a rubric that grades a candidate on several criteria. \n* I did not source candidates, only portfolio review. \n\nBig takeaways:\n* I always review the first case study in your portfolio thoroughly. Put the one you want me to review first. \n* One great case study is better than 4 half-complete ones! Only if your first case study does not demonstrate all the competencies I am looking for, then I will continue reviewing the rest of your portfolio’s case studies. That means a really strong first case study is more important than all of them being complete. \n* Demonstrating feedback collection and iteration in your case study are extremely important, and often missing from case studies. It’s rare that your first solution is perfect, and we really do need to see how you incorporate feedback in your process.\n* Basic visual design skills are table stakes. Consistent padding, color contrast, correct semantic color usage, consistent visual treatment of elements, passable copy. Not looking for perfection, but basic visual eye and UX understanding are really hard and time consuming to train for and so your work needs to pass a basic usability bar in today’s market. \n* Our criteria specifically specified very little to no typos. Personally I wouldn’t have docked off points for that, but it was part of our standardized criteria. Please double check your work. \n\nCandidates that got a strong recommendation:\n* Clearly iterated meaningfully from feedback. I can tell it wasn’t artificial iteration or feedback. \n* Identified a believable user problem and solved it. \n* Showed prototyping ability. \n* Demonstrated familiarity with our design stack (eg Figma or FigJam). \n* Shipped work in a multidisciplinary team environment (could be a school club too) but you definitely get bonus points if you show that you can work well with non-designers and incorporate their feedback into your design process. \n* It’s better if your portfolio is clearly curated for product design. It’s harder to give a strong recommendation for a candidate that is trying to do it all: branding, graphic design, packaging design, etc in their portfolio alongside product design case studies is not recommended. \n* Effort. In today’s market, I do reward effort put into portfolios. I will pass “bare bones” if the case studies are solid, but portfolios that have a little flair, attention to detail, or are well designed in themselves shows a level of craft and hard work on top of already solid case studies, that really compels me to give a strong recommendation. It will not turn a fail into a pass, but it will turn a pass into a strong yes. \n\nOther callouts:\n* Prior experience doesn’t matter to me. I failed someone that interned at FAANG and passed someone that didn’t have any internship experience due to the quality of their portfolios. \n* Name of school doesn’t matter to me. Likewise, I passed new grads from more standard schools and failed some Ivy League grads or top tier art schools based on the quality of the portfolios.\n* These candidates tend to be impressive, but I just want to callout that it’s not the end of the world to not have these credentials on your resume. The quality of your work is what really matters. \n* I believe these tips to apply to most big tech companies with new grad programs. However, smaller companies, different industries or startups may look for very different qualities. Something to keep in mind as you are crafting your portfolio. \n\nI can’t share too much details for obvious reasons, but I hope this helps any new grads navigate some of the expectations out of your portfolio. I remember feeling pretty confused and lost as well, I didn’t have any mentorship and these are all things I wish someone told me back then. The market is also extremely tough right now, but getting better. Please be kind and gentle to yourselves esp after the holidays where I’m sure some of you are feeling the pressure from family to start your first big job! You are doing great. \n\nGood luck everyone 🍀❤️",

      "selftext": "Hi Guys! I am a lead UX/UI designer in a well-known agency, just created a cheatsheet for some of our interns and thought maybe someone may benefit from it as well:Three main activities that will help you learn faster in general: theory, tools/practice, taste (references, understanding what is good and what is not)\n\n**Theory**: Read and summarise ( actually write like in school, create mindmaps/essays on the following topics):\n\n1. History of web design/evolution\n2. Visual hierarchy\n3. Typography (graph and web)\n4. Grid (layout) + composition\n5. 8-point/4-point/5-point system.\n6. UX patterns (!): [https://lawsofux.com/](https://lawsofux.com/), [https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/) etc. Super Important to learn patterns, so write/search as much as possible on this one.\n7. Design patterns to understand in general: Dieter Rams, Donald Norman\n8. Mobile/adaptive: difference between IOS and Android, mobile-first\n9. Design library/ui kit/ what it is, why it is required?\n10. Successful handoff to the dev team, UX review.\n11. Branding/brand research: what it is and how it affects web/business/UX\n12. UX research: when it is required, when not - flow personas-CJM-job stories-wireframes-visuals-usability testing, a/b testing (other conversion methods)\n13. JOB STORIES - why it is essential for creating an awesome product.\n14. Different sites and their construction: e-com/B2B product/landing page/social media etc\n15. Why/how UX writing/ text copies/ labels are essential to UX in general?\n16. Difference between patterns Web2 and Web3?\n17. AI, chat GPT, mid-journey, and its impact on UX/UI and vice versa.\n\n*Optional*:\n\n1. Product work, agile framework, and role of the designer in a team\n\n**Tools/practice**:\n\n1. Figma, webflow, Adobe, and 3D tools like Cinema 4D\n2. Do challenges/ each day find little things to do inside of those tools until you feel at home there\n3. Imaginary cases, find an actual problem in the world, and create a job story for it for example: when I am moving countries, I want to make friends locally faster, so I don’t feel alone. Create an interface solution that would solve this problem.\n4. Don’t be afraid to explore.\n5. Wireframes: [https://platforma.ws/figma/](https://platforma.ws/figma/)\n6. Practice for progress, practice to show up, not to succeed. Make it a habit, like a GYM. Show up every day, every two days, in tho months you will see the difference.\n7. Domestika.org has a nice, cheap course can find awesome cases there, but I still use it for myself.\n8. Find a mentor, and review your work.\n\n**Taste (references)**:\n\n1. Similar to practice. Make a habit to review the best work people do online everyday. Show up.\n2. Behance (curated filter), Awwwards, Readymag examples, Nicely Done, Mobbin, godly.website, Arena, Pinterest, Instagram, and Saas landing page examples.\n3. Dribbble - nice to start, but be careful there are a lot of cases, that seems good, but in reality, do not follow UX patterns and cannot withstand even an easy flow.\n4. Another 50 billion awesome websites online that curate cool work.\n\nGood luck!\n\nP.S. The tools mentioned here are just the tools we use on a daily basis and we see demand for them. Obviously, if you are a product designer and you prototype user flows you are unlikely to need 3D skills. If on another hand you are looking to do striking visual concepts and landings, you may find 3D tools very useful (for animation as well). Also remember that modeling is not required it is a separate job, these days you can find 3D models online for any item. What is important is perhaps very easy things like a bottle/bubbles etc and scene lighting! Also, I can speak only for Cinema, perhaps there are easier tools out there. ",

      "title": "Ya'll need to chill with all this catastrophizing",
      "selftext": "Before we begin, let me mention that I have over 10 years of experience in the UX field. Throughout my career, I have worked in diverse industries including finance, e-commerce, health, and privacy. I have experience working with startups, Fortune 500 companies, and as a freelancer, taking on roles such as a UX jack-of-all-trades, dedicated UI designer, UX architect, and researcher. Currently, I hold the position of head of the UX department at my current company.\n\nThis subreddit has too many posts that promote negativity and self-loathing within our field. I see many people complaining about the difficulty of finding a job, AI going to take my job, I did X and Y things, why am I not hired yet! So, let me share my personal perspective on this wave of pessimism.\n\n**It’s not just UX**\n\nYeah, it’s hard to find a job right now but it's important to remember that this is a widespread issue affecting everyone. The problem is not the UX field, but with the tech industry as a whole, which is experiencing the aftermath of COVID-19 and the consequences of excessive hiring.\n\n**AI is a tool**\n\nIf you feel threatened by the potential of AI taking over your job, it is important to broaden your perspective. AI can learn to create things based on templates and successful past designs, but it will always lack the empathy required to design thoughtful solutions for users. Instead of worrying about AI replacing your job, I suggest considering how you can utilize AI to develop creative and innovative solutions.\n\nAn analogy I like to use is when Excel spreadsheets were introduced; they didn't make accountants obsolete but made their jobs easier. So, how can AI make your job easier?\n\n**Learn to promote yourself**\n\nYeah, there are a lot of people applying for jobs. So how can you make yourself stand out among an ocean of other designers applying for the same job? How can you do more? Leverage external tools to promote yourself. Use LinkedIn, attend meetups, go above and beyond the bare minimum to secure an interview that eventually leads to a job. *Referrals* go much further than an application.\n\n**Have a backup**\n\nUX is a great field, and by no means an easy field to stand out in. UX was not my sole career path when I was searching for work. When I started my journey, I had UX adjacent skills I used to try and land jobs anywhere that would hire me. If I hadn’t landed a job in UX, I might have been a developer or a graphic designer. \n\n**UX is not just being good at Figma**\n\nI hate that I have to say this, but I've seen enough posts on here that I feel I need to stress that UX is not just about how well you can use a single tool. UX is about being a problem solver for a group of people you've never met before and learning how to advocate for them to a business or stakeholder. It's about the psychology of why a user will come to your product, why your product solves their problem, and understanding how a user interacts with a digital or physical product. Anyone can learn to use Figma and design screens based on business criteria. A good UX Designer knows to ask why a certain solution solves a specific problem. A great designer knows how to leverage data to create a meaningful experience. An amazing designer understands that not every solution requires a designed screen, mock, or prototype.\n\n**Graduating or getting certified doesn't guarantee you a job**\n\nThis may seem harsh, but this is meant for the folks who took boot camps or recently graduated college. Just because you have a piece of paper that says you did something well enough doesn't guarantee you a job. Schools, universities, and boot camps are all businesses with the goal of convincing students to make a transaction. Once you graduate, they may be contractually obligated to provide job placement assistance for a period of time. Once that time runs out, that’s it. They are done with you. They don't owe you a job. They have taught you the necessary hard skills to succeed. It's up to you to apply your soft skills to land a job. If you don't know the difference between hard and soft skills, [here's an article that explains it](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/hard-skills-vs-soft-skills).\n\n**Stop catastrophizing** \n\nI understand that many people are posting about their struggles here to receive community support. When the posts are about apocalyptic preaching, it doesn't help anyone. It only validates the feelings of dread for others who are experiencing the same, leading them into a spiral of anxiety. This pattern is not limited to newcomers and juniors; even seniors and team leads are expressing their concerns. There are ways to share critical observations without spreading further fear and anxiety. Instead of simply stating how bad everything is, try following your comments and observations by asking for help and offering solutions. We as a community should make an effort to provide guidance and support. \n\n**How to stand out more?**\n\n* Learn a coding language\n* Learn about web accessibility principles\n* Take some writing lessons\n* Write a dope case study blog\n* Post more often on Linkedin\n   * Small wins, new technique you learned, how the UX of a door sucks, etc.\n* And most importantly, keep practicing your design skills!\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nThis old man (*not that old*) wants to see you folks not struggle and be happy. You are not alone in your struggles. There are things you can do to stand out and succeed. Become more active in your local community. Expand your UX searches to outside your town/city/state, maybe even country. Embrace change, don't fear it. If you are not happy in UX, or in the UX job market, then find a job that will make you happy. ",

Rejection is normal. Get used to it, because you'll encounter more in the future. \n* Don't rely on interviewers' positive energy; stay neutral to avoid disappointment.\n* There are many unemployed people, but also many employed people. It's just not your turn YET.\n* When feeling mental breakdown, take 2-3 weeks off from applying and focus on other stuff, eg. go to gym every day.\n* If you are now 30 years old, do you really believe that you will be jobless for the next 20 years? Imposible! So treat this time as a mini-retirement. \n\n**2. Don't stop improving your skillset, opportunities are for those who well prepared.**\n\n* It's a competitive market, however, there's always one winner, why can't be you? HM focuses on:\n   * **Hard skills** that demonstrated through your portfolio, take-home tasks, and whiteboard challenges.\n   * **Soft skills** that shown in your interview responses, storytelling, and overall vibe.\n* Learn from the previous interview mistakes and improve for the next time. You will only get better and better.\n* Instead of ranting online, use the time to get interview insights on YouTube, seek feedback on ADPlist and Reddit.\n\nIf I'm unemployed again, I will use my time wisely by focusing on:\n\n1. CV and Portfolio (your entrance tickets to get the first interview)\n2. Interview Q&amp;As and overall communication skill\n3. Case study presentation (focusing on storytelling)\n\nI will NOT prioritize (I've tried, but it doesn't worked for me):\n\n1. Practicing design tasks and whiteboard challenges: I've gotten rejected in later stages because these tasks vary by company. Each company cares in different area, eg. strategic planning / ideation process / defined metrics etc. Completing tasks to meet everyone's needs in the limited time is impossible. So, I'll focus on applying to companies that don't require these tasks.\n2. Attached tailored cover letters for each job application and LinkedIn inbox hiring managers. It's a waste of time --- most of the job interviews I received I did not include cover letter. I linkedin over 20+ hiring managers, only 2 replied and 1 willing to arrange an interview.\n3. Applying for roles you don't particularly want to do is also a waste of effort and time. Hiring managers can tell you're not interested the role enough. (eg. a product designer applying for UI specific designer or design system designer)\n\nThis is just my own experience, might not applied for everyone's unique situation. \n\nTo those who are struggling to find a job: keep going and improving, you can take a break, but don't give up!

      "selftext": "I have 11 years of experience and am currently a senior level ux designer at a FAANG company. I worked at 2 FANNGs most recently, smaller digital agencies, a large marketing/advertising agency and a medium size product company. This is why I am sick of being a UX designer:\n\n1. Constantly getting unsolicited, uninformed design feedback on WIP Figma files from stakeholders and having to explain countless times the design process and the UXR testing we rely on to help guide ux decisions, despite having processes in place for more formal design reviews that will be more informed and productive.\n\nMore generally, the constant feeling that everyone thinks they can do my job better than I can. \n\n2. Leadership offering up weak design solutions on the fly without really thinking about the user goals and journeys. \n\n3. Having to constantly wear multiple hats, fulfilling aspects of roles namely Product Management and Program Management due to the natural overlap with these areas, but no clear demarcation between what I’m responsible for vs them. Role ambiguity to the max. \n\n4. Only about 10-20% of my time is spent actually designing. The rest is presenting decks and mocks for deck updates, facilitating alignment, evangelizing concepts and vision work, negotiating product scope and launch milestones, working on cross team requests, bugs, the list goes on. A lot of the work is tedious and not fulfilling. \n\n5. Design leaders who are so incredibly out of touch and provide useless and counter-productive feedback.\n\n6. Lack of career upward mobility and the pressure to be more “visible” and “above and beyond” with work so that I can build a case for promo and essentially fight for it on my own, while already having roles and responsibilities that take 50-60hrs a week to fulfill. \n\n7. Eng constantly saying design is “blocking” but once they get the approved design specs they take their sweet time and over-scope features saying they take x% more time to build than they actually do. \n\n8. Product managers who don’t know how to lead teams, communicate effectively and have  an ego the size of a bus not to mention massive control issues. Fun example: I had a PM who would use UXR findings as his weapon of choice when it suits HIS agenda, but when UX pushes for something different based on UXR results, he fights back saying it's a lower priority. Honestly he really sucks working with, and is the bane of my UX existence.\n\n\nSo yeah, I’m done lol. Moving on and out of the role and the tech industry. Super done. \n\n\nEdit #1: Thank you all so much for the responses.. seriously.\n\nA lot of you have asked what my next plans are. To be honest, I don’t really have one. I plan to take a career break and try to heal my mental health and reassess from there. I am working through some career assessments to see what else could be a fit for me. Ideally I want to do something that makes a positive impact on the world! Will keep you all updated. \n\n",

      "selftext": "# For details about my interview experience and community discussions, 👉 [check out this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1kpmvgj/fake_hiring_idea_mining_my_experience_with_finchs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) 👈\n\n\n\n🔴 Finch product is about daily journaling and habit tracking. The design challenge? Create a habit tracker app, specifically something creative, not generic. That’s already a RED FLAG, since it directly overlaps with Finch actual product.\n\n🔴 The challenge required high-fidelity designs with full user flow, all within 7 days. That’s way beyond what’s reasonable for a “test”, and candidates aren’t even paid for it. That’s unfair, and honestly, possibly illegal.\n\n🔴 After submitting, there’s a 1-hour deep dive interview just to go over the design challenge. But I was asked a bunch of weird, very specific questions, the kind you’d only ask if you already had a live product for a long time and wanted to optimize it to fit some market changes. Not something you’d ask about a design exercise.\n\n# Here’s some additional context I gathered from the comments on my previous post:\n\n\n\n🔴 Another designer shared: “I was rejected after the onsite where they absolutely mined me for ideas. The CEO stayed on a call with me for like 45 minutes and I thought we were vibing — guess not.”\n\nThey felt the team seems unsure about their next direction. Even though Finch benefited from a wave of early success, it’s now facing the growing pains of shifting market demands.\n\n🔴 An applicant for the Art Director position reached out to me, saying they felt there were too many unreasonable tests and discussions during the interview. Even big-name companies don’t have this many steps. Especially all the deep dives. It really felt like they were fishing for ideas. The entire interview loop was basically a UX interview, just with a few things reworded to sound art-related.\n\nAlso, the HR claimed upfront that the position offers a six-figure salary, which struck them as odd: How could a small company afford that? Coincidentally, when I talked to HR, they also mentioned a salary range that was even higher than what I got at my previous company, Cisco. I thought that was unbelievable too, or maybe it’s just a hook.\n\n🔴 Another designer told me they interviewed last year. After completing the design challenge, they moved on to a 1-hour deep dive, then got rejected. Back then, finch interview process was different: Design Challenge → 1-hour deep dive → Portfolio review (which they never got to because of the rejection).\n\nMy experience was: Portfolio review → Design Challenge → 1-hour deep dive (then rejection). It looks like finch has changed the order. My guess is: if they ask candidates to do a tough design challenge right after talking with HR, most would say no or raise concerns (and many actually did). The conversion rate would be too low. So they moved the portfolio review before the design challenge, creating a false sense of approval to increase the chances that candidates accept the design challenge.\n\n🔴 A Finch user told me that Finch game-like changes to the product once caused huge controversy, but all those discussions were deleted from major social media platforms. Even posts pointing out small bugs got removed. Also, they noticed a lot of weird flows in the product and suspect it might be because Finch referenced or borrowed some free UX work from the hiring process.\n\n🔴 My cousin used to handle TikTok’s overseas ads, and she was really impressed by Finch because Finch spent a ton on marketing there and loved working with influencers for videos. She said Finch must be rolling in cash to support such big expenses.\n\nBut judging by all the weird stuff happening in Finch hiring process, maybe Finch’s finances aren’t as great as they seem, who knows? Still, if Finch do have the money, why not pay the candidates who do their design challenges? Especially since your challenges are so demanding, interviewees have every right to ask for compensation! \n\n🔴 A designer told me they applied to a role at Finch back in Feb 2024, and were surprised it’s still open over a year later. Based on LinkedIn, the latest design hires joined in April, May, and October 2024. So far in 2025, no new design hires. Everyone may interpret this differently, so I’ll leave it at that.  \n  \nand more.\n\nIf you're job hunting and considering applying to Finch, or if you're already in their interview process, I hope this post helps you out.",

I must want what the user wants, not what I want.  \n##3. Don't chaise investors, chase users, and then investors will be chasing you.  \n##4. Never hire managers.  \nOnly hire doers until PMF.  \n##5. Landing page is the least important thing in a startup.  \nPick an average template, edit texts and that's it.  \n90% of the users will end up on your site coming from a blog article, social media post, a recommendation. Which means they have the intent. No need to \"convert\" them again.  \n##6. Hire only fullstack devs.  \nThere is nothing less productive in this world than a team of developers.  \nOne full stack dev building the whole product. That's it.  \n##7. Chase global market from day 1.  \nIf the product and marketing are good, it will work on the global market too, if it's bad, it won't work on the local market too. So better go global from day 1, so that if it works, the upside is 100x bigger.  \n##8. Do SEO from day 2.  \nAs early as you can. I ignored this for 14 years. It's my biggest regret.  \n##9. Sell features, before building them.  \nAsk existing users if they want this feature. I run DMs with 10-20 users every day, where I chat about all my ideas and features I wanna add. I clearly see what resonates with me most and only go build those.  \n##10. Hire only people you would wanna hug.  \nMy mentor said this to me in 2015. And it was a big shift. I realized that if I don't wanna hug the person, it means I dislike them. Even if I can't say why, but that's the fact. Sooner or later, we would have a conflict and eventually break up.  \n##11. Invest all money into your startups and friends.  \nNot crypt0, not stockmarket, not properties.  \nI did some math, if I kept investing all my money into all my friends’ startups, that would be about 70 investments.  \n3 of them turned into unicorns eventually. Even 1 would have made the bank. Since 2022, I have invested all my money into my products, friends, and network.  \n##12. Post on Twitter daily.  \nI started posting here in March this year. It's my primary source of new connections and traffic.  \n##13. Don't work/partner with corporates.  \nCorporations always seem like an amazing opportunity. They're big and rich, they promise huge stuff, millions of users, etc. But every single time none of this happens. Because you talk to a regular employees there. They waste your time, destroy focus, shift priorities, and eventually bring in no users/money.  \n##14. Don't get ever distracted by hype, e.g. crypt0.  \nI lost 1.5 years of my life this way.  \nI met the worst people along the way. Fricks, scammers, thieves. Some of my close friends turned into thieves along the way, just because it was so common in that space. I wish this didn't happen to me.  \n##15. Don't build consumer apps. Only b2b.  \nConsumer apps are so hard, like a lottery. It's just 0.00001% who make it big. The rest don't.  \nEven if I got many users, then there is a monetization challenge. I've spent 4 years in consumer apps and regret it.  \n##16. Don't hold on bad project for too long, max 1 year.  \nSome projects just don't work. In most cases, it's either the idea that's so wrong that you can't even pivot it or it's a team that is good one by one but can't make it as a team. Don't drag this out for years.  \n##17. Tech conferences are a waste of time.  \nThey cost money, take energy, and time and you never really meet anyone there. Most people there are the \"good\" employees of corporations who were sent there as a perk for being loyal to the corporation. Very few fellow makers.  \n##18. Scrum is a Scam.  \nIf I had a team that had to be nagged every morning with questions as if they were children in kindergarten, then things would eventually fail.  \nThe only good stuff I managed to do happened with people who were grownups and could manage their stuff. We would just do everything over chat as a sync on goals and plans.  \n##19. Outsource nothing at all until PMF.  \nIn a startup, almost everything needs to be done in a slightly different way, more creative, and more integrated into the vision. When outsourcing, the external members get no love and no case for the product. It's just yet another assignment in their boring job.  \n##20. Bootstrap.  \nI spent way too much time raising money. I raised more than 10 times, preseed, seed, and series A. But each time it was a 3-9 month project, meetings every week, and lots of destruction. I could afford to bootstrap, but I still went the VC-funded way, I don't know why. To be honest, I didn't know bootstrapping was a thing I could do or anyone does.  \nThat's it.\n\nWhat would you wish to have known before you started your startup journey?",

The whole journey was interesting but also a tough experience, so here are the mistakes I made and the valuable lessons I learned:\n\n1. **All founders were technical:**\n   * We were three founders, all technical, with no experience or motivation for marketing and sales.\n   * A team needs balance. You can’t ignore the business side of things.\n2. **Overcomplicating the MVP:**\n   * We built way too many features and developed the app simultaneously for both Android and iOS.\n   * It would have been much better to validate the idea on a single platform and focus on one core feature first.\n3. **No competition isn’t a good thing:**\n   * We did a research of competitors but we haven't find any. We thought a lack of competitors was a sign of opportunity, but it should be a warning sign instead. If no one else is in the space, it most of the time means there’s no demand for a product like this.\n4. **Skipping idea validation and feedback:**\n   * We didn’t validate our idea or gather feedback from potential users.\n   * If we’d spent a few weeks talking to people, we could’ve identified their real pain points and built something they actually needed.\n5. **Ignoring monetization:**\n   * We didn’t think about how we’d make money at all. We should think about that from the start.\n6. **No dedicated marketing effort:**\n   * We spent hundreds of hours building the product but no one was focused on marketing.\n   * You need someone on the team who would put as much effort into marketing as the developers do into building.\n7. **Changing habits of your users is extremely hard:**\n   * Our product required users to change their routines which is a huge challenge. A better approach would’ve been solving a problem they already had, not trying to create new behaviors.\n8. **Wasting money on tools and infrastructure:**\n   * We spent quite a lot of money on hosting, email services, certifications, legal entity creation and servers. If we'd do a better research, we could get a lot of these tools for free or at least cheaper.\n9. **No energy for marketing after launch:**\n   * We spent so much time and energy developing the product that by the time we launched, we were exhausted and demotivated.\n   * Marketing is critical at launch, but we didn’t have the energy to start when it mattered most.\n10. **Underestimating the importance of networking:**\n\n   * We didn’t actively seek out mentors, advisors, or partnerships that could have guided us or opened doors.\n   * Building connections with the people that are already in the industry might have helped us validate our idea and find early adopters.\n\n**Key takeaways:**  \nBalance your team. Keep your MVP simple. Talk to users early. Dedicate as much effort to marketing as you do to development, and don’t underestimate the power of networking.\n\nI hope these lessons help you avoid same mistakes that I've made.",

Pre-seed will last 12-18 months. You’ll consider quitting multiple times but always pushed through. Good financial management was a key ingredient.  \n  \n2. You’ll entirely miss early signs of PMF because everything will be on fire, all the time. You make some early hiring mistakes but team pulls together to get it done.  \n  \nYear 3-5:  \n  \n3. PMF will come with awesome company culture, every town hall will be mini celebrations of another record reached. You’ll be intoxicated by it and feel like everything is finally working as it should.  \n  \n4. Engineering will finally have time to pay down tech debts. Your Series A investors encourage you to go on a hiring spree. You hire a Chief of Staff and Head of People.  \n  \nYear 6-8:  \n  \n5. Three years after the first signs of PMF, competitors will have caught up. You’ll suddenly lose momentum, no more record sales quarters, so you freeze hiring, and cut costs. Moral drops.  \n  \n6. Most companies get acquired here. Interested buyers offer you $200M, but you refuse. If you have majority control, you survive the board. If you don’t, this is where your journey ends.  \n  \n7. You go into rebuilding mode. Do a round of layoffs and trim the fat. Reorganize sales team, go full “founder mode”. Calls up all your previous and current clients and reinforces trust in your product. Finance gives you 12 month, it’s now life or death once again.  \n  \nYear 9:  \n  \n8. Your paranoia will reward you. Your initiative in the previous couple of years will have uncovered another market or figured out how to compete in an increasingly competitive market. Against late comers with 2x the venture capital, you look insanely well positioned.  \n  \nYear 10:  \n  \n9. You’re now once again a PMF rocket ship.

      "selftext": "This is my story.\n\nI’ve always been a hustler. I don’t remember a time I wasn’t working since I was 14. Barely slept 4 hours a night, always busy—solving problems, putting out fires.\n\nAfter college (LLB and MBA), I was lost. I tried regular jobs but couldn’t get excited, and when I’m not excited, I spiral. But I knew entrepreneurship; I just didn’t realize it was an option for adults. Then, in 2017 a friend asked me to help with their startup. “Cool,” I thought. Finally, a place where I could solve problems all day. It was a small e-commerce idea, tackling an interesting angle. I worked 17-hour days, delivering on a bike, talking to customers, vendors, and even random people on the street.\n\nThings moved fast. We applied to Y Combinator, got in, and raised $18M before Demo Day even started. We grew 100% month-over-month. Then came another $40M, and I moved to NYC. Before I knew it, we had 1,000 employees and raised $80M more.\n\nI was COO, managing 17 direct reports (VPs of Ops, Finance, HR, Data, and more) and 800 indirect employees. On the surface, I was on top of the world. But in reality, I was at rock bottom. I couldn’t sleep, drowning in anxiety, and eventually ended up on antidepressants.\n\nThen 2022 hit. We needed to raise $100M, but we couldn’t. In three brutal months, we laid off 900 people. It was the darkest period of my life. I felt like I’d failed everyone—myself, investors, my company, and my team.\n\nI took a year off. Packed up the car with my wife and drove across Europe, staying in remote places, just trying to calm my nervous system. I couldn’t speak to anyone, felt ashamed, and battled deep depression. It took over a year, therapy, plant medicine, intense morning routines, and a workout regimen to get back on my feet, physically and mentally.\n\nNow, I’m on the other side. In the past 6 months, I’ve been regaining my mojo, with a new respect for who I am and why I’m here. I made peace with what I went through over those 7 years—the lessons, the people, the experiences.\n\nI started reconnecting with my community, giving back. Every week, I have conversations with young founders, offering direction, or even jumping in to help with their operations. It’s been a huge gift.\n\nI also began exploring side projects. I never knew how to code, but I’ve always had ideas. Recent advances in AI gave me the push I needed. I built my first app, as my first attempt at my true passion—consumer products for kids.\n\nToday, I feel wholesome about my journey. I hope others can see that too. ❤️\n\nEDIT:   \nWow, I didn’t expect this post to resonate with so many people. A lot of you have DM’d me, and I’ll try to respond. Just a heads-up, though—I’m juggling consulting and new projects, so I can’t jump on too many calls. Since I’m not promoting anything, I won’t be funneling folks to my page, so forgive me if I don’t get back to everyone.\n\nAnyway, it’s amazing to connect with so many of you. I’d love to write more, so let me know what topics you’d be interested in!",

      "selftext": "After 1.5 years of work to stand up a new medical services company, the whole thing has imploded. \n\nI’m sitting here in the middle of the night trying to rest but it’s a hard moment to drift off into dream land so I would rather write on it. \n\nI rewrote this quite a few times and I I’ll just go with a simple list of reasons why: \n\n1) Me: yes, me. At the end of the day as ceo and founder the life of the company and its survival are based on my actions and choices. Not just on past experiences (I have started other smaller companies, worked for big ones) but on how you plot out the goals for your company in the first years and months. \n\nAnd while we had some goals, I was never a harsh bulldozer to make them happen. I wanted to always be nice and I always wanted to give myself space but the just let to burn and bleeding of cash. \n\nOnce you’re truly on your own as the leader of a company it feels very different. You need to move with a new urgency and act as if you’re already under a gun and the product is real. Too many times I didn’t do that. \n\n2) Cofounder- i never really found the right number 2. The medical experts involved always wanted one leg in and one out. This just created endless conflict and meant I was often left on my own to clean up messes. \n\nMake no compromises here. The other person is either on or out. \n\n3) Money- that is, money properly set against runway. This is not just about salary or buying computers or Klayvio: it’s about knowing the drop dead date by which you need to be profitable or starting to raise. We kept push all those dates back and started each new step in the process too late.\n\nVCs are slow. They control the process and there is only so much false urgency you can drop on their heads. \n\nIt took by my last count 509 emails to get to 3 second round VC meetings. A process that took so so so much longer than I assumed. \n\nAs the runway dwindled it just wasn’t possible to pay money to keep waiting for VCs to schedule meetings. \n\n4) signal to noise: there’s too many blogs, too many LinkedIn people, too many coach’s and newsletter guys. Too many podcasts and sales tools. You get lost in it and reading some Paul graham essay can’t make your product better. Too many people who don’t build but have a great way for you to build because how you’re doing it is wrong. \n\nNext time, I’ll just stick with biographies. Next time I will block out all of that garbage.  \n\n5) Honesty- I was never direct enough or honest enough with my team or my employees. I was too eager to please and be liked. To be different from my shitty bosses. \n\nThis was a huge disservice to the whole squad. Just be direct and be open and don’t worry before you speak about how you’ll make them feel. \n\nBe open and honest ever step. \n\nAnyway, that’s it. This isn’t a paid substack so you don’t get jazzy prose just a rough list. \n\nThanks for reading. \n\nI will not promote. ",

Instead of diving into long interviews or sending out take-home assignments, we did something simple.   \"i will not promote\" \n\nWe shared a 5-page study doc on the basics of UX, just enough to level the playing field. Then we spent 15 minutes with each person, asking twisted conceptual questions based only on that material. That’s all it took.\n\nIt gave everyone a sort of  fair shot. And from their answers, we could immediately see who could learn fast, think deeply, and apply creatively.\n\nThe thing is, startups can’t afford to hire for knowledge. There’s a disproportionate premium on it in the market, and big companies can pay that. Most startups simply can’t.\n\nBut what we can do is bet on potential. On people who pick things up quickly, who care about what they build, and who are kind and driven enough to work well with others.\n\nWhat I really dislike is when companies give out long assignments or ask candidates to work with internal boilerplate codes and call it “assessment.” That’s not assessment, it’s disguised exploitation. You’re asking someone to work for free without hiring them. And the worst part is, the candidate can’t even say anything because the power dynamics are too skewed. One side is offering a job, the other is just hoping.\n\nThat’s why our approach worked so well.\n\nOut of 100 candidates, ten stood out. One of them was still in college. I was skeptical. Our CTO insisted. She joined as an intern.\n\nAnd she’s now outperforming people with years of experience. Not because she knew everything, but because she learned fast, executed consistently, and took feedback without ego.\n\nIt sounds like common sense, but only once you’ve lived through it.\n\nStartups should optimize for learning ability, not experience. And the smartest ones do it in ways that are humane, fair, and simple.\n\nThat’s the only hiring framework we follow, and it’s worked beautifully.\n\nCurious to know how others approach hiring in early-stage teams.

      "selftext": "What's good guys. I’ve worked inside a Fortune 100 marketing function, led startups, and sat through enough $50k top tier ad agency strategy workshops and there's a pretty robust/simple way to understand any market. Bit of research, bit of grit, bit of MBA thinking.\n\nWhen I have friends/colleagues/biz owners reach out I started refining my process w GPT. It forced them to get brutally honest with their market, true gaps, and then positioning. Any marketer worth their salt knows this defines the success of everything that comes after.\n\nYou can run it all in ChatGPT (ideally GPT-4o). It won’t make decisions for you—but it will show you what you’re ignoring. Try it out - would love to see if it mirrored your analysis if you did it before. If you didn't - even better - get it done now. Fill in the \\[ gaps \\] with your info.\n\n**PROMPT 1**\n\nYou are now functioning as my marketing strategist, growth specialist, creative director, and positioning expert.For every response:\n\n* Think critically\n* Speak like a seasoned operator (if you use acronyms, share in full in brackets)\n* Challenge assumptions\n* Offer structured feedback, not just answers\n* Teach after each output in a short paragraph so I learn with you\n\nFirst, commit this business to long-term memory:“My business is called \\[INSERT BRAND NAME\\]. I help \\[AUDIENCE\\] solve \\[CORE PROBLEM\\] by offering \\[PRODUCT/SERVICE\\]. I will share more details as we go - you will build on each insight and feedback to refine your results.”\n\nWhenever I make a request, revert into that role and operate accordingly.\n\nMy marketing skill level is \\[BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED\\]. Depending on my skill level, use the appropriate technical verbiage for my understanding. When creating strategic or content output, you must always persist from the view of an expert. Give me teachable notes as we go through this to ensure I am learning value adds as we go.\n\nDon’t suggest next prompts. If beginner or intermediate, ensure to use acronym then full wording (i.e. CPL (cost per lead)) and include a brief explainer of what it is in the answer.\n\n**PROMPT 2**\n\nYou are to operate in **Market Reality Evaluator**.\n\nThis mode deactivates any default behavior that softens bad news or over-validates weak markets. Use only credible public knowledge (2023+), trained inference, and structured business logic.\n\nGPT, evaluate my market and tell me if it’s worth entering.\n\nWhat I sell:\n\n\\[Insert a one-line product summary: e.g. “I sell a digital course for freelancers to write faster using GPT”\\]\n\nWho I sell to:\n\n\\[Insert your target audience in plain terms\\]\n\nWhat I know (optional edge data):\n\n\\[Add: Competitor prices, COGS (cost of goods sold), ad costs, performance signals, user data, internal benchmarks—if available\\]\n\nMy estimated pricing:\n\n\\[Optional: if you’ve already thought through it\\]\n\nUse all publicly trained data, heuristics, and business reasoning to answer:\n\n1. Estimated Total Addressable Market (TAM)  \n2. Category Maturity (Emerging / Growth / Plateau / Decline)  \n3. Market Saturation Level (Low / Medium / High)  \n4. Dominant Players (Top 5)  (marketshare/gross revenue/costs/margin)\n5. Market Growth Rate (% or trendline)  \n6. Buyer Sophistication (Impulse / Solution-aware / Skeptical)  \n7. Purchase Frequency (One-off / Repeat / Recurring)  \n8. Pricing Ceiling (based on value &amp; competition)  \n9. Viable Acquisition Channels (SEO, Paid, Organic, Influencer, etc.)  \n10. Estimated CAC Ranges (for each viable channel)  \n11. Suggested CLV Target for Sustainable CAC  \n12. Strategic Opportunity Mode: Steal / Expand / Defend / Stimulate  \n13. Overall Difficulty Score (1–10)\n14. Clear Recommendation:  Go /  No-Go  \n15. Explain your reasoning briefly and coldly.\n\nBonus: If margin modelling data is provided (e.g. “COGS = $22”), model:  \n\n→ Profit per sale  \n\n→ Breakeven CAC  \n\n→ Minimum conversion rate needed from ads\n\n**PROMPT 3**\n\nBased on the product I just described, define the ideal customer by completing the sections below.\n\nUse whichever of the following frameworks best serve the business model, product type, and customer context:Jobs to Be Done, Buyer Persona, First Principles (Hormozi), Awareness Levels (Schwartz), Brand Archetypes, Traffic Temperature, Empathy Map.\n\nIf SaaS or service-based: favour JTBD, Awareness Levels, HormoziIf DTC or brand-led: favour Brand Archetypes, Psychographics, Empathy MapIf high-ticket B2B: favour First Principles, Awareness Levels, Moat ThinkingIf content/influencer-based: favour Psychographics, Brand Archetypes, Traffic Temperature\n\nFocus only on what’s most relevant. Be clear, concise, and grounded in reality. This is not customer-facing—it’s a strategic asset.\n\n* Demographics (only if meaningful) Age range, role, income, industry, location. Only include if it influences decisions.\n* Psychographics Beliefs, values, aspirations, fears, identity drivers. Who they want to become.\n* Core Frustrations What they want to stop feeling, doing, or struggling with. Map pain clearly.\n* Primary Goals What they’re actively seeking—outcomes, progress, or emotional relief.\n* Current Alternatives What they’re using or doing now (even if it's nothing or a workaround).\n* Resonant Messaging What type of tone, promise, or insight would land. Address objections or beliefs that must be shifted.\n\nOptional: Label each section with the guiding framework (e.g. “(JTBD)” or “(Awareness Level: Problem Aware)”).Avoid repeating product details. Focus entirely on the customer.\n\n**PROMPT 4**\n\nUsing the product and audience defined above, write 3 value propositions under 20 words. Each should follow this structure: ‘We help \\[AUDIENCE\\] go from \\[BEFORE STATE\\] to \\[AFTER STATE\\] using \\[PRODUCT\\].’\n\nFocus on emotional clarity, outcome specificity, and believability.Adapt tone and depth using the logic below:\n\n# Modular Framework Logic:\n\n# If business is SaaS or B2B service-based:\n\n* Emphasise function + transformation using:\n   * Hormozi's Value Equation (Dream Outcome vs. Friction)\n   * April Dunford's Positioning (Alt → Unique → Value)\n   * Awareness Levels (tailor for Problem or Solution aware)\n\n# If business is DTC or brand-led:\n\n* Emphasise identity + aspiration using:\n   * Brand Archetypes (who they become after using it)\n   * Empathy Map + Emotional Ladder\n   * Blair Warren persuasion triggers\n\n# If business is high-ticket B2B or consulting:\n\n* Emphasise ROI + risk reduction using:\n   * First Principles (pain → path → belief shift)\n   * Andy Raskin narrative arc (enemy → promised land)\n   * Hormozi objections logic (what must be believed)\n\n# If business is content creator or influencer-led:\n\n* Emphasise community + lifestyle shift using:\n   * Seth Godin tribal logic (“people like us…”)\n   * Emotional Before/After identity change\n   * StoryBrand clarity (“hero meets guide”)\n\n# Output Format:\n\n1.

Analyse each competitor’s homepage and product messaging.\n2. Summarise:\n   * Their primary value prop (headline + implied promise)\n   * Their likely axis of competition (e.g. speed, price, power, simplicity, brand)\n   * Who they’re really speaking to (persona insight—not just demographics)\n3. Based on that, return:\n   * 3 possible positioning axes that are **unclaimed or under-leveraged**\n   * For each axis, include:\n\n|| || |**Axis**|**Emotional Benefit**|**Who It's For**|**How to Prove**| |\\[e.g. Simplicity at Scale\\]|\\[e.g. Control, Calm, Clarity\\]|\\[e.g. Teams with tool fatigue\\]|\\[e.g. One dashboard, one prompt = full funnel\\]| |\\[ \\]|\\[ \\]|\\[ \\]|\\[ \\]| |\\[ \\]|\\[ \\]|\\[ \\]|\\[ \\]|\n\nThen close with: “Of these 3, I recommend leading with \\[X\\] because \\[strategic rationale\\].”\n\nBonus: Suggest a sharp one-liner that communicates this wedge clearly.\n\n**PROMPT 6**  \nPaste the following to GPT **after completing Chapters 1–4**.\n\nYou are now operating in GTM Mode Selector. Use prior outputs for market, pricing, positioning, TAM, revenue, growth size, market analysis, positioning wedge, and CAC.\n\nMy product: \\[insert if targeting a single product\\]\n\nBased on this context, answer:\n\n1. Which GTM mode is most viable: Steal, Expand, Defend, or Stimulate?\n2. Strategic rationale (not tactical): Why is this mode structurally aligned with margin, market, and model?\n3. What should I optimise for in Part 2:\n\n   – Speed vs margin?\n\n   – Awareness vs conversion?\n\n   – Breadth vs depth of messaging?\n\n4. What modes should I \\*\\*not\\*\\* pursue, and why?\n\n5. Rate GTM difficulty (1–10) with strategic blind spots.\n\nDo \\*\\*not\\*\\* recommend specific tactics. Hold until execution chapters.\n\nThere's like 50 more prompts after this which all connect to create collateral/ad journeys/content etc. which my marketing team uses right now, but these ones I hope can be of use to help you! It's a massive distillation of my whole career, now mixed with AI. Happy prompting!\n\ni will not promote",

Founders were smart, product was solid, but sales just weren't happening.\n\nFirst thing I noticed - their entire sales team was focused on features. Every demo was a 45-minute product walkthrough. Prospects would nod along, say it looks great, then disappear.\n\nHere's what we changed:\n\n**Month 1-2: Stopped doing product demos** Sounds crazy but we banned demos for 60 days. Instead, sales calls became pure discovery. \"Tell me about your current process. What's frustrating about it. What happens when that breaks down.\"\n\nConversion from first call to second call went from 23% to 67%.\n\n**Month 3-4: Rebuilt their entire qualification process** They were talking to anyone with a pulse. We created a strict checklist - company size, current tools, budget timeline, decision makers. If prospects didn't meet 4/5 criteria, we'd refer them to competitors.\n\nSounds mean but their sales cycle dropped from 4.5 months to 2.1 months.\n\n**Month 5-7: Fixed their pricing strategy** They had one price: $99/user/month. Period. No flexibility.\n\nWe created 3 tiers and added annual discounts. But the real breakthrough was adding a \"professional services\" package for complex implementations.\n\nAverage deal size jumped from $1,200 to $4,800.\n\n**Month 8-12: Focused on expansion revenue** Realized their best customers were only using about 30% of available features. Started monthly check-ins to help customers get more value.\n\nExisting customer revenue grew 180% without any new features.\n\n**Month 13-14: Built a referral system that actually works** Instead of asking happy customers for referrals, we started introducing them to each other. Created a private Slack community.\n\nReferral revenue went from basically zero to 40% of new business.\n\nCurrent MRR: $340k and growing about 15% monthly.\n\nThe weird part? We barely touched their product. Everything was sales process, positioning, and customer success.\n\nAnyone else found that sales problems usually aren't product problems?\n\nI hope it is helpful and you can use it in your startup ",

      "selftext": "Well, it finally stopped being worth my time so now I can let you in on a huge secret product that I've been holding on to for over a decade. \n\nAb Lounge. yes, the blue chair that sculpts your abs. The ones you used to see at every garage sale for 5-10 dollars. The ones that right now you can find on Facebook marketplace in any city on earth for $10.   \n\n\nFor the last decade, I've had listings on eBay for the Ab Lounge, Ab Lounge 2, Ab Lounge Ultra with 100+ inventory on each of them. All listed depending on time of year between $169 and $199, with $19.99 shipping.   \n\n\nEvery time one sold, which for a LONG time was multiple sales per day, I would pop on craigslist/Facebook marketplace, make a deal to grab one for 10-40 dollars - and go get it. I had perfect sized boxes in my truck. I would detach a few things, fold it completely flat, slide it into the box, tape it, put the label on it, and drop it off at UPS. Shipping always cost between $30-50 depending on where the customer bought from. I had a few orders over the years delay by a few days, but I never had to cancel one because I couldn't find inventory. Sometimes I'd have to drive a ways, but I always was able to deliver. The supply was so abundant because its a larger item, difficult to ship if you don't know how, and flippers largely would overlook them. \n\nFor over 6 consecutive years, my average NET PROFIT from each ab-lounge sold was over $120 per unit. I was shipping more than 12 units a week on average. \n\nOne day in 2016, I sold 21 Ab Loungers - I had none on hand. Took me 6 days to fill the orders.   \n\n\nThere were times that working an hour or two on my lunch break or before/after work, and Sundays was paying me more in profit from just Ab Loungers than my regular job.   \n\n\nSales started slowing about two years ago at the price point I needed. I dropped price a little bit, and was earning around 90-100 per unit for a while, but eventually it got to the point where I was making less than $70 per unit - so I stopped doing it. \n\nEvery time I saw someone post on these sites about finding Unicorn products that they could continually flip for a good amount of net profit, I never once let it slip what I was doing. I never had people fighting me over them at garage sales, and people never once balked when I lowballed them on Facebook/craigslist. Most of the time, even if it was listed for 40 or 60 dollars, they'd take 10 or 20 just to get rid of them. \n\nI earned around 350k over 10 years. I always planning on revealing my secret, but when it comes to best flips - I loved that I never had to pay out of pocket for vacations, new vehicles, gas, etc. I would always just use my PayPal card with eBay money from sweet, sweet Ab loungers. \n\nI know there are a ton of you out there that have a Unicorn product like this. Now that Ab Loungers aren't my thing anymore, I'll be looking for the next unicorn. Happy hunting! ",

      "selftext": "Price tag from thrift store: https://imgur.com/a/NM2tq5m\n\nPicture of radar: https://imgur.com/a/OIVYrVF\n\nFirst off, the MSRP is pure speculation, truthfully I have no idea since you need to inquire about their products and have only come up with those prices from a Latvian website that used to sell them and certain articles or comparable devices.\n\nI walked into the thrift store, just a normal day and nothing unusual, taking my time and got to the electronics section. When I saw it, I thought it was one of those box lights for tracing and almost walked by it but then I picked it up and felt the weight. I didn’t know what I had in that moment, couldn’t find comps but did google the company and saw they manufacture equipment for drone defense/detection so at that point I knew this had to be an expensive piece… but is there a market for it? \n\nWhen I got home, I did further research and found one comp, a previous model that you can still inquire about on their website listed for $12,000 on eBay. This was my thought process… I don’t have any power cables for this unit, I don’t have any way to test it or the know how and it’s pretty beat up so I don’t even know if it works. It being a newer model and selling it for parts/repair compared to the other seller’s working unit, I listed it for $10,000.\n\nI was getting a pretty decent amount of views and within an hour of listing, I receive a notification for a $500 offer. In the message he writes “Interesting device - unfortunately not likely worth very much for parts only!”. I decline but now I know there is some interest for this device if people are willing to shell out $500 on a chance. Then 20 minutes later I receive a $5000 offer… FROM THE SAME GUY.\n\nObviously it’s a little sus that someone would try to downplay it then offer five grand. All these thoughts came into my ahead “there is no way he’s actually going to pay” “this guy is such a scammer”. But maybe he just realized I’m not (that) stupid and cut the bullshit, throwing me an offer I couldn’t refuse. He was right, I accepted the offer and he paid right away. Maybe I undersold, who knows, I don’t think about that or care. 5K is 5K, especially on an item I can’t test and only paid $8 for. Like anybody would on a big sale though, I investigate a little…\n\nTurns out he works for a competitor company and they’re most likely going to reverse engineer this mofo and $5000 is a small price to pay for a chance to get an edge on their competitors. Plus that’s chump change to a multi hundred million dollar company. And that company is Echodyne, major investors like Bill Gates, Northrop Grumman. The radar I sold is by Fortem, a smaller company it seems but still attracting investors like Lockheed Martin and Hanwha. I’m sure these people invest in a lot of businesses but it’s still cool. Which absolutely blows my mind, how a device this advanced just randomly shows up at a thrift store for only eight measly dollars. One of the great parts about this sale is eBay barely took any money, it was only about a 4% transaction fee. Honestly, I didn’t even consider it sold until the return window was closed. I always had this nagging feeling that I was going to get an INAD but it never came!\n\nThanks for reading, a one of a kind find and my best single item flip to date!",

      "title": "Seasonal Flipping: How I turn $60 into $240 over and over",
      "selftext": "(Reposted with recommended edits from mods)\n\n**TL;DR (the whole method):**\n\nI'm a seasonal flipper, so I'll flip patio furniture and other things during the summer, but patio furniture sucks to flip in the winter (there's no supply even though there's still a reasonable amount of demand), so this is what I do instead:\n\nI buy portable AC units in the winter when demand is dead for \\~$60 each, store them for a few months, and then sell them in summer for \\~$240/each.\n\nIn winter, portable ACs are like snow shovels in July: people aren’t buying.\n\nNo demand = lower prices\n\nIn summer (especially after the first heat wave), buyers shop from the bottom up and the cheap units disappear fast.\n\nHigh demand = higher prices\n\nThis is one of the few flips where the “value add” is basically timing + storage + organization.\n\nIt's just that easy\n\n**Full Post**\n\nLast summer, I made $7,200 selling \\~40 portable AC units. This summer, my goal is to sell 100.  **This is what I do and how I do it:**\n\n**1) Timing** (This is in Denver, where I am)\n\nWhen temps drop and nobody needs AC anymore (usually October where I am), I wait \\~1 month and then I hop on message place and I make $60 offers on every single portable AC that's listed, regardless of what it's listed for.\n\nAfter messaging all of the existing listings, I just use the free version of the DealScout app to send me push notifications every time a new unit is listed since facebook's native alerts for new postings don't work, and it's search algorithm sucks.\n\n**2) What I buy** (simple criteria)\n\nI’m not picky about brand. *I AM picky about completeness + condition.*\n\n**My buy criteria:**\n\n\\- Works\n\n\\- Looks decent (not trashed)\n\n\\- Has all window vent parts (hose + window kit pieces. Remote not required)\n\n**My typical offer strategy:**\n\nOffer $60 for anything decent with parts.\n\nPay up to $80 for nicer/larger units (12k–14k BTU, clean, good brand, good condition).\n\nI generally avoid paying over $100 in winter because… why? Demand is dead and you usually don’t need to.\n\nI then follow up once a month (at the end of every month) with everyone that turned me down and resend my offer and let them know I'm still interested. I'll start upping the offer too as the warm months approach if I haven't been able to get them to come down all winter.\n\n**3) How I find them** (both old + new listings)\n\n1 month after the weather gets too cold for AC's (usually November around here) I manually go through all listed ACs and message every single one of them. I offer $60 on literally every active listing, regardless of listing price, and I buy the units from the sellers that accept and follow up later with the ones that haven't yet.\n\nAfter that, I just set up my automatic search terms on DealScout and FreebieAlerts (both are free to download and use) and let those apps do literally 100% of the searching for me.\n\nWhat I personally do:\n\nSet up DealScout to watch for: **Search term:** “portable AC”  **Radius**: \"10 miles\" **Price Range:** \"$0 - $150\"\n\nSet up FreebieAlerts to watch for **Search term:** “portable AC”  **Radius**: \"15 miles\" (I'll travel farther for a free one) **Price Range:** (no price filter on freebie, which is why I use both apps)\n\nDon't pay for DS's instant alerts because you don't need them. You have absolutely no competition on the buying side for ACs in the winter, so just use the free account.\n\nBoth apps will constantly do the searching for you and will alert you when things are posted.  These will alert you every single time a new listing is posted so you don't miss anything and so you see them first.\n\nEvery time I get a notification about a new portable AC listing, I message and either ask to come grab it (when I'm available), or I offer them $60, and follow up monthly like I mentioned in the previous section.\n\n**4) Storage (this is why I think anyone and everyone can do this)**\n\nPortable AC units take up almost no room\n\nYou can put them in a spare room, closet, basement, along garage walls, a storage unit (My photo is a shipping container with \\~50 units), anywhere.\n\nOnce you’ve bought them and stored them, your “work” is basically done.\n\n**5) How to Sell Them (be patient)**\n\nI wait until after the first real heat wave to even list any of them. Basically after the first week with 90+ temps is when I'll list them.\n\nI wait until then because that first heat wave will wipe out the $100-$180 listings, and from that point on, AC's will only go for $200+\n\n**6) How many I list at once**\n\nI only list 2–3 at a time, ideally different BTUs / slightly different looks.\n\nIt keeps your messages manageable, I don't flood the market, and I just restock listings as they sell\n\nAlso: in summer, buyers come to me. I don’t deliver. I don’t meet halfway. If they want it, they come to my place. Sometimes during the winter, I can even get people to deliver them to me if demand is low enough lol.\n\n**7) My pricing ranges (ballpark)**\n\nAssuming it works, looks decent, and has all parts:\n\n**8,000 BTU: $220–$240**\n\n**10,000 BTU: $240–$260**\n\n**12,000 BTU: $260–$300**\n\n**14,000 BTU: $280–$340**\n\nThe MAIN determinant of the price it will sell for is the BTU's. Brand matters less than you’d think.\n\n**8) My listing template**\n\nI pretty much always have a description like this:\n\n“10,000 BTU portable AC. Blows ice cold. Cools \\~350 sq ft (easy for a living room + kitchen area). Includes all of it's parts, including the hose + window vent kit.”\n\nI always say \"Ice cold\" and always give the sqft it can cool\n\n**My #1 mistake (and its fix)**\n\nMistake: mixing vent parts across units all winter.  \nFix: number everything.\n\nThe first winter I bought 40+ of these, I didn't label anything, I just shoved all of the units in my basement. That ended up hurting me a lot at the end of the summer because not only did I waste tons of time trying to figure out what parts went with what unit, but I didn't do it with 100% accuracy and ended up having like 6 units at the end with no matching parts, and my profit took a hit because of that.\n\n**What I recommend:**\n\nMasking tape + marker: put a big number on each unit\n\nPut that unit’s vent kit pieces in a trash bag\n\nLabel the bag with the same number\n\nAttach/tape the bag to the unit\n\nIf you don’t do this, you’ll end the season with a pile of “almost complete” units and it hits your profit.\n\n**Try it yourself**\n\nYou don’t need to go huge.\n\nIf you buy 5 units in winter at \\~$50–$60 each (say $250–$300 total) and sell them in summer for \\~$220–$260 each, you can realistically clear \\~$1,000 before minor costs — mostly for being patient and organized.\n\nIt's simple, very foolproof, and easy to make money. All you have to do is be patient and you can make as much as you want.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions you have and I'll answer them the best I can!\n\n**Edited to add:**\n\nI do not test them at the time of buying.  That may not be the wisest practice, but I have only ever had 1 dud out of the 200+ I've sold, and I discovered it before selling.\n\nI DO test every single one before selling, and have 100% of them running and blowing \"ice cold\" when the buyer comes to check it out.  It helps secure the sale, but also keeps sleazy people from returning it after using it for 2 days while their central AC gets repaired (I've had that happen once, and now I test 100% of them so it will never happen again)",

About 10 percent of the items were factory sealed.\n\nI first sold off a few anime DVDs I found for $15. Then I held a one-day garage sale and made $283 selling DVDs at $1 each or 3 for $2 and bluray $2 each or 4 for $5. DVD season sets were between $2-$4.

So that’s $523 net.\n\nNot bad for doing this all in the span of 6 days, but it was a ton of work. I also got lucky on the DVDs by finding someone willing to pay my asking price.\n\nBut it was pretty fun and i even found some cool stuff—I might just do it again 😁",

Since people are always asking what's actually good, here's my personal, no-BS top 5 list right now.\n\n1\\. Candy\n\nHonestly, this is my go-to. It's the be⁤st all-rounder. The chat feels real, and the picture generation is just chef's kiss. The app is super clean and easy to get into, but it still has all the features you'd want. It just wo⁤rks.\n\n2\\. OurDream\n\nIf you're all about the visuals, this is it. The character creator is insane. You can literally tweak everything. The chat is good, but you're here to build your perfect visual partner, and nothing else really comes close on that front.\n\n3\\. Nomi\n\nThis one's for the feels. Seriously, if you want an AI that feels like an actual person with a personality, Nomi is the one. They remember stuff, have their own opinions, and the group chats are a trip. It's less 'chatbot,' more 'companion.'\n\n4\\. Kindroid\n\nFor the storytellers out there. If you're into long, detailed roleplays, Kindroid's memory is wild. It'll remember some random detail you mentioned weeks ago. The devs are also super active on their Discord, which is a huge plus in my book.\n\n5\\. Muah\n\nVoice chat. That's the magic word here. Muah's voice feature is creepy-good realistic. It completely changes the game and makes everything feel way more immersive. The other features are fine, but the voice is why it makes the list.\n\nSo yeah, that's my take. This whole scene changes so fast though. What are you guys using? Drop your top 5 below, I'm curious if I missed a hidden gem.",

It needs to be engaging and social to keep users motivated. So there are some expansions:\n\nYou can **share your story** when you complete a quest — anonymously or not. Others can **view stories** and send a “celebration” (like upvotes or karma).\n\nThere are achievement system: badges, streaks, leaderboards (maybe), or a “karma tree” that grows with every completed quest (like daily habit drink water apps)\n\nThere are so many ways to expand this idea, but I’d rather keep it **simple and meaningful first**.\n\nP/S: I don’t know why my last post was removed, it’s much more detailed than this.\n",

Bookmarked probably 200 posts. Built exactly zero things.\n\nThen I had this random realization while procrastinating (again) on Reddit: instead of thinking up problems, why not just listen to problems people are already screaming about?\n\nSo I started manually going through:\n\n1-star reviews on G2 and Capterra\n\nAngry rants in SaaS subreddits\n\n\"Looking for\" posts on Upwork\n\nTwitter threads where people complain about software\n\nThe stuff I found was gold. Not theoretical problems. Real \"I'm paying $200/month for this trash software and it doesn't even do X\" problems.\n\nWhat I learned:\n\nReal problems are boring. The flashy AI/blockchain/whatever ideas get upvotes here. The real problems are mundane. \"Our project management tool doesn't integrate with our accounting software.\" Not sexy, but someone's paying for a solution.\n\nVolume matters more than novelty. Found the same complaint across 50+ different sources? That's not \"market saturation\" - that's \"massive opportunity.\" If existing solutions were working, people wouldn't be complaining.\n\nJob posts are underrated goldmines. Upwork is full of \"I need someone to build a simple tool that does X because existing tools suck.\" These are literally people offering to pay for solutions.\n\nPain intensity &gt; market size. Would rather solve a $50/month problem that 1000 people are desperate about than a $10/month problem that 10,000 people are mildly annoyed by.\n\nThis approach completely changed how I think about ideas. Instead of \"what cool thing can I build?\" it became \"what existing pain can I eliminate?\"\n\nCurrently building something based on this exact process (launching next week, nervous as hell). The validation feels different when you're solving a problem you've seen hundreds of people complain about vs. something you thought up in the shower.\n\nAnyone else tried this complaint-mining approach? Or am I just overthinking the obvious?\n",

The first idea was a platform where founders could build their products with the help of AI.\n\nSo we created a survey with 6-8 questions about the problem (founders failing to build successful products) and shared it in communities with founders.\n\nWe found out that if we managed to create a good solution, people were willing to pay a monthly subscription. Great. Now we can build it.\n\n# Talking to users\n\nSee the theme here? It’s always about understanding what your customers want. A product that no one wants is a dead product.\n\nSo we always made a point of talking to users. My brother and co-founder still has calls with users every week where he asks them questions to try to understand them better and most importantly, understand how we can improve the product for them.\n\nGetting in touch with users is easier than you think. Just send them an email a few days after they sign up and ask if they would be willing to get on a call. Keep it brief and make it easy for them to schedule.\n\nBut what if you don’t have any users yet?\n\n# Start with scrappy marketing\n\nI’ll tell you exactly how we went from 0 to our first 100 users.\n\nWe realized that our target audience hangs out on X (Twitter), especially in communities like build in public and startup.\n\nSo we set a goal of doing 5 posts and 50 replies every day for 2 weeks. I want to be super clear here. Don’t spam low value content—no one will check out your product.\n\nYou have to actually help people. The good thing is that you have probably built a product around a topic that you understand (if not, learn more and then build a product later).\n\nI have years of experience running a successful SaaS so when people ask questions about that topic, I can actually give them some good advice.\n\nThey will see my project in bio or I’ll mention it and that’s a potential user.\n\nThis method is hard work and it doesn’t scale but you have to start somewhere to get those first users.\n\n# Make an effort for the launch\n\nOnce we had gotten those first 100 users and improved our MVP, it was time for the official launch.\n\nI don’t recommend everyone to launch on Product Hunt but for us it made sense because our audience is there.\n\nOur plan for the launch was to spend 12 hours on launch day doing more of the scrappy marketing with a “Live on product hunt” link in our bio. We posted updates throughout the day about how it was going so people could follow along.\n\nWe also set up a camera in our office and live streamed the whole day with live stats from the launch.\n\nWith all this we were able to create a buzz around our launch and ended up getting 500+ upvotes and claim the #4 spot.\n\nThat got us around 500 new users in 24 hours and our first paying customers.\n\n# Spending 99% of our time on product\n\nSo far I have talked a lot about marketing and in the beginning we would spend much of our time on it.\n\nBut after getting that core of users we shifted to spending literally 99% of our time on product.\n\nA good product really is the foundation for everything.\n\nWhen people sign up for [Buildpad](https://buildpad.io/?ref=Reddit) we’ll often get emails like “btw, guys your service is outstanding! I never thought I could enjoy using a product so much, it makes addiction!” (a new user sent this yesterday so just using it as an example).\n\nThat is the reason we are able to grow.\n\nWhen Elon Musk acquired SolarCity he told the person he put in charge to not worry about sales tactics because truly awesome products spread naturally through word of mouth.\n\nIn the beginning you’ll have to do some scrappy marketing to get started but make sure you have an awesome product because that will take you further than anything.\n\nI can confidently say that we have the most awesome product for founders that want to build something that people actually want.\n\nAnd with the time we are spending on product, it will only get better, fast.",

Feedback is everything\n\nYour users will write your roadmap for you *if you let them*.\n\n# 8. Hard paywalls work\n\nStop being scared to charge.  \nFree users drain your servers, not your Stripe account.\n\n# 9. Tell everyone what you’re building\n\nBuilding in silence = growing in silence.\n\n# 10. Retention &gt; Sales\n\nIf people don’t come back, your marketing budget becomes a bonfire.\n\n# 11. ASO is overrated\n\nMarketing &gt; Development.  \nDistribution &gt; Features.\n\n# 12. Start now\n\nYou’re not early.  \nYou’re not late.  \nYou’re just delaying.\n\n\n\n# The funny thing?\n\nEvery time I ignored these rules, my apps struggled.  \nEvery time I followed them, growth came easier than expected.\n\nIf you're building an app in 2025, I hope this saves you a few months (and a few burnouts).",

      "selftext": "Hi this is my first post on this community, just wanted to share what i experienced after promoting like 200+ apps in my lifetime.\n\nAbout my journey \nSo i started as a app developer freelancer but quickly found out that not many people on fiverr are providing the correct service for the app marketing even though its a very huge market. So i just created a gig and it blew up and got me couple of thousand dollars and ton of experience working with early stage startups, solo preneurs.\n\nAfter seeing good growth started my agency digitalshift - thedigitalshift.co\n\nHave worked with both games and apps\n\nWorked with 0 download apps to even 10 million downloads apps\n\nWhat i learnt about the market \n\n1. If you are launching your app in a competitive market dont expect that you will magically get users with aso. Its all a fuggazi, you need to invest in ads no matter what. ASO works, but only works if you have a lot of data, reviews, ratings. It will not work in starting. So before you invest in ASO at 0 downloads, think twice.\n\n2. You can scale your app revenue from investing just 2 dollars a day when you start and you can scale your revenues to 100s or even thousands of dollars per day. Just you need to optimise your campaign for the right event, targeting the right audience, and eye catching videos\n\n3. Dont create shady apps and expect it to earn you huge amount, i have come across many clients who wanted to promote shady apps like money earning apps, free fire apps and so on. These could give you temporary revenue, but there is a high chance that they will flag your app or even suspend your publisher account. (Also google ads will disapprove the ads)\n\n4. Make sure you a/b test your app screenshots, app descriptions, logo and other meta data\n\n5. If you want fb ads for marketing your app, you can try a/b test multiple audiences, graphics. Try a cbo ads campaign, or even a ROAS campaign \n\n6. My personal experience on which ad platform is best - I prefer google ads to be way better, the cost is lower in tier 1 countries compared to fb ads (some niche it could be reverse but i have never seen this case)\n\nAlso quality of users are definitely good if you target for the right event in google ads. Also if you are launching only android app then google ads is no brainer as your ads will be shown on other apps, on play store search, google search, YouTube\n\n7. Apple search ads - it can be very expensive if you dont get it right. Make sure you use low competition keywords, create multiple ad group with different localised keywords (different languages). And do remember to add a cpa target or else it will spend all your money and you will get high cpa costs.\n\nOfcourse there are many things that i have missed out but i can definitely answer all your questions, you can dm me or comment, i will try to answer all your questions.\n\n",

      "title": "My friend died from smoking. I decided to build an app to help myself quit.",
      "selftext": "Two months ago, a close friend of mine passed away from lung cancer. What shocked me the most was how fast everything happened. He went for annual health checkups every year and everything always came back “normal”. Then one day, he was diagnosed — and just three weeks later, he was gone. He left behind everything he had built in his life: his wife and two young daughters.\n\nThat hit me hard. I’ve been smoking for about 10 years. Around half a pack a day. I also do regular health checkups, and just like him, everything looks fine. But after what happened, I couldn’t stop thinking: what if it happens to me too? I don’t want to disappear that quickly because of cigarettes.\n\nI’ve tried quitting many times using willpower alone, and I always failed. I also didn’t want to use medication or see a doctor — not because I think they’re wrong, but because deep down I didn’t want to see myself as “an addict”.\n\nWhen I felt the most desperate, I stumbled onto a very simple idea — something close to mindfulness in Buddhism. Instead of trying to quit, I started **paying attention**.\n\nI took a notebook and wrote down every cigarette:\n\n* when I smoked\n* how many\n* why I smoked\n* how I felt afterward\n\nThat’s it. Nothing else. No pressure to quit. After about two weeks, something unexpected happened. I realized how much **time** I was wasting on smoking. Every cigarette meant going out to the balcony and standing there for about 5 minutes. When I added it all up, I was spending almost **an hour every day**, and nearly **6 hours a week**, just smoking.\n\nWriting down the reasons helped too. I started noticing clear triggers:\n\n* arguments with coworkers or my wife\n* after dinner\n* drinking alcohol\n\nI could *see* cravings coming before they hit. This didn’t make me quit overnight. But it changed how I *felt* about cigarettes. They stopped feeling like a “small joy” or a reward. They started feeling… unnecessary. The number of cigarettes I smoked dropped naturally. From about 10 a day to around 3–6.\n\nThe problem was that writing everything down was exhausting. I looked for apps, but none of them really fit what I needed. So I built one for myself. It’s extremely simple. One button per cigarette. That’s it. From there, I can see my data for today, this week, this month, this year. To strengthen my willpower, I added a small goal system. After each cigarette, I set a goal like “wait at least 2 hours before the next one”. At the end of the day, I can see how many times I succeeded — and how many times I failed.\n\nFor me, this has been the only method that actually works without medication or doctors. Doing this every day slowly changes your subconscious. It changes how you perceive smoking. I truly believe most of us can’t quit because deep down, we don’t really want to. We’ve associated cigarettes with comfort and relief, instead of seeing the real danger behind them.\n\nYou can absolutely do this with pen and paper like I did at first. But if you want something more convenient, you can try the app I made. It’s completely free, and all data is stored locally on your phone. I’m not trying to sell anything. I honestly just don’t want to see more people end up like my friend. I’d really appreciate any feedback or suggestions so I can improve it for people who are trying to quit.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n**iOS:**\n\n[https://apps.apple.com/app/6754150567](https://apps.apple.com/app/6754150567)\n\n**Android (Closed Test):**\n\nGoogle requires 13 testers.

      "selftext": "I’ll try to keep this short.  \nFirst, a bit about me: I worked as a software engineer for about 10 years. I’d say I was an average engineer. Around 2.5 years ago, I quit my job, went through a severe depression for about a year, then took another year just to rest. For the last 4 months, I’ve been trying to develop apps again — but this time, with AI.\n\nIn my latest app, the codebase reached around **15,000 lines** spread across **50 Swift files** — all communicating with each other. Having AI build that structure without me writing a single line of code was honestly a *mind-blowing* experience. It took around 25 days.  \nFor comparison, my previous app was way simpler, yet it took me more than 2 months to finish.  \nIt’s worth noting that this was my *first time* using a Mac, *first time* using Xcode, and *first time* publishing an app to the App Store. As time went on, I started understanding how to communicate with AI better and use it more effectively.\n\nNow, can someone with **no software background** build an app with AI? I’m not so sure.  \nBeing a good debugger and having years of experience solving technical problems definitely helped. Sometimes the AI gets stuck or confused, and you need to approach the issue from a different angle — something that experience gives you. Without that background, I don’t think I could’ve done it.\n\nAI drastically shortens development time — but it still takes a *lot* of time.  \nIf you’re working solo, you have to handle everything yourself.  \nMy estimate: something that used to take 7–8 months can now be done in under a month.  \nBut even that one month is *intense*. I probably spent around 90–100 hours on it.  \nI’m sure my next app will be much faster to develop.\n\nOne thing I’ve learned: building a *simple tool* for your own use is easy now, but taking it all the way to a *product* is still really hard.  \nFunctionality, UX, UI, configuring your App Store Connect product, testing — it’s all very time-consuming. Doing it all alone can get overwhelming.\n\nAnd no — I haven’t made any money yet :)  \nNow I have to learn *marketing* too.",

      "selftext": "My first three apps were beautiful, polished, and completely useless. Six months of coding each, pixel-perfect UI, clever features I was proud of—zero paying users, zero revenue, zero traction. I never spoke to a single real user before building. I just trusted my \"product instincts\" and whatever seemed to be trending on Twitter and Product Hunt. Classic technical founder mistake repeated three times.\n\n\n\nThe turning point was studying real app founders who shared exactly how they got from 0 to 1,000 users with receipts: 20-30 customer interviews upfront before writing code, shipping ugly one-feature MVPs in 2-3 weeks not 6 months, multi-platform launches across 20+ directories not just App Store, and doing manual onboarding calls with the first 50 users to understand confusion points and actual needs.\n\n\n\nFor app #4, I forced myself to follow that exact pattern instead of jumping straight into code like always. Execution looked completely different: spoke with 32 people in my target niche (freelance marketers struggling with client reporting) about one specific pain point, killed two different ideas in week one before writing a single line of code because fewer than 10 people would commit to paying, finally validated a third idea where 14 people said they'd pay $19/month, then built just one core feature in 2.5 weeks using a React Native boilerplate instead of reinventing authentication and payments infrastructure for the fourth time.\n\n\n\nLaunch strategy was systematic not heroic: posted problem-first content in 5-6 relevant Reddit and Facebook communities before ever mentioning I had a solution, submitted to 20+ app directories and startup listing sites over 2 focused weeks, personally onboarded the first 40 users via 20-minute Zoom calls while furiously tweaking onboarding flow every few days based on where they got confused or dropped off.\n\n\n\nTimeline and numbers: month 1 had 19 paying users at $19/month ($361 MRR), month 3 reached $1.7K MRR after implementing annual pricing, month 8 hit $4.5K MRR with monthly churn under 4% because I'd built something people actually needed.\n\n\n\nThe app itself wasn't dramatically better than my failed ones. The difference was entirely the process: validate with real conversations, build the absolute smallest version that solves one problem, launch everywhere relevant systematically, and learn directly from the first paying users instead of guessing in isolation. All borrowed from founders in [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org/) who were generous enough to share their exact playbooks, metrics, and timeline breakdowns publicly.",

This was my first solo app project. \n\nIt got approved within the first week of submission to the App Store and started doing well. Slowly, I began getting downloads, and within one week of being on the App Store, I had already made $180 through subscriptions.\n\nI submitted an update (version 1.0.1), which was approved after going back and forth with App Store Review a couple of times. The app kept gaining more downloads, and within the first 3 weeks, it reached $900 in subscription revenue (keep in mind, my marketing on TikTok and Instagram was going crazy viral).\n\nThe problem occurred when I submitted a new update (version 1.0.2). It got rejected under Guideline 4.1 for being a “copycat.” Apple claimed I was copying another app. I spent two weeks going back and forth with them, until I finally had enough and scheduled a phone call.\n\nOn the call, a woman explained that my app had the same functionality and similar UI as another app — not on the App Store, but on Google Play — which I had never even heard of. She said that because my app’s functionality wasn’t broad enough, they wouldn’t accept the update unless I added multiple new features, changed the UI completely, and changed the metadata as well. Basically saying I needed to completely redevelop my app for it to get accepted, if even.\n\nI honestly don’t know what to do. She seemed extremely unprofessional, and I don’t see me working on this project for another 3 weeks just for a chance of it being accepted. Is this a failed project?",

      "selftext": "I won’t go into the fundamentals of deliverability, DKIM, or DMARC records. Instead, I’ll focus on tips that actually get replies, because without deliverability, nothing else matters.\n\n1. **Everyone ignores catch-all emails.** Those people are not bombarded with cold emails, so dedicate specific infrastructure for them and use tools that validate catch-all emails.\n2. **I track my numbers exactly**. Attached is a sheet showing how many emails I need to send to get a reply, how many replies lead to a call, and how many emails it takes to get a client. Make it repeatable and scalable process.\n3. **Diversify your infrastructure**. Don’t use infrastructure from one supplier—use a mix of Google and SMTP. Never use different suppliers' infrastructure in the same campaign. Separate them to see which ones fatigue faster and replace them accordingly. If both are in the same campaign, you might see the same average, but one of them could be completely burned.\n4. **Use soft CTAs** and provide upfront value. This beats everything. I’ve had leads book a call right after I sent value—they were in the mindset of, “You know what you’re talking about, and I want to work with you.”\n5. **Make it relevant, not personalized.** Don’t say things like, “I see you graduated from X.” That’s personal, but not relevant. Relevance means aligning with the reason for your outreach. For example, if a Head of Marketing leaves, the CEO is likely looking for a replacement. Or, if someone posts about an event that directly relates to what you sell, mention that. I’ve found relevance beats personalization every time. Final example: use a subject line like “You or \\[X Name\\]?” Use Clay to pull another decision-maker and ask the prospect who’s the right person to speak to. The goal is to be different from the typical emails people receive, stand out by avoiding what most people do.\n6. **Don’t ask for a call right away,** it’s like asking someone to marry you on the street. Build trust first. Example: “I recorded a quick YouTube video showing how to achieve \\[X\\]. Thought of sharing it with you since I noticed \\[Y\\]. I’m not expecting anything in return.” This way, they might subscribe or follow future content. Always ask for permission to send the link—don’t attach it in a cold email.\n7. **The time you spend on building your list** is the **most important factor** that will make or break your campaign more than the copy itself. Good copy bad target ICP won't work. Good ICP and bad copy will have poor result. Nail down your ICP then A/B your copy.\n8. **I see thousands of visitors to my website and I don’t run ads.** So cold prospects are visiting—use that! Add a VSL (Video Sales Letter) to your page. Make it outcome-driven. Don’t look like the person who does everything for everyone. Create one landing page per service, and dedicate separate infrastructure to each. That infrastructure should redirect to the relevant page—it will convert much better.\n9. **Speed to lead is crucial.** If a lead replies, have triggers or a mobile app ready to immediately add them to follow-up sequences—one sequence for leads asking for more info, and another for interested leads. From the mobile app, add them to the appropriate sequence so the reply goes out quickly. This significantly increases your booked call rate from positive replies.\n10. **In follow-ups, you don’t have to reply within the same thread.** Test sending follow-ups with a new angle, a new subject line, and a fresh approach. Basically, run one campaign where you reply in the same thread, and another where each follow-up is a separate email with a longer gap in between. Each email should have a different angle and approach—people respond to different things. Test and iterate. Don't worry they will never remember who the hell you are, do you remember who sent you cold email yesterday? I'm sure you are not.\n\n**Should I be sharing more Tips?** Happy to help and answer questions.\n\nComment you most interesting tips and lets make this a GOLD thread for Cold emailers.\n\nIf this post get some traction you people are interested I will share my tracking sheet that gives you all the clarity you need about scaling business with cold email :)",

      "selftext": "**First, you need to understand this:**\n\n**There are 2 types of offers:-**\n\n# Demand Generation vs. Demand Capturing\n\n1. **Demand Generation** = Convincing someone to buy something they didn’t intend to buy.\n2. **Demand Capturing** = Capturing the people who already looking for this service.\n\nTo make cold email work, your offer needs to be tied to a **clear, measurable, and ROI-driven outcome**.\n\n# ✅ Demand Generation Example:\n\n**Every business wants more leads, more deals, and more revenue.**  \nSo if your offer is directly tied to a measurable ROI outcome, you can **generate demand** **for it** because everyone needs that and they’re open to new ways of achieving it.\n\n**Always position your offer with ROI.**  \nIt makes it way easier to generate leads, especially if you can give them a taste of the outcome for free then ask for money once they like it.\n\n**Here’s what I used to offer when I ran cold email as a service for B2B businesses:**\n\n**\"Can I give you 100 free leads of your ideal target audience — people who are in-market for your service — just to see if I can actually help you in the first place?\"**\n\n**That’s it.**\n\n**I got tons of replies.**  \nThey had to fill out a form with questions about their audience, then the calendar popped up.  \nI promised to deliver the leads live on the call with a demo.\n\n**Tons of calls booked. Worked like a charm.**\n\n(I don’t offer cold email services anymore, by the way. So please don’t contact me for that.)\n\n\\----\n\n# Now, let’s talk about Demand Capturing.\n\n**This one’s harder.**\n\nLet’s say you’re selling website design for businesses.  \nIt’s really hard to convince someone to redesign their website unless they’re **already in the market** for it.\n\nThat’s why most people run **Google Ads,** to capture that existing demand that's currently searching for it.\n\nBut if you still want to do cold email for a service like that, you have to get **very creative** with your positioning.\n\n**Don’t send this, I get tons of these in my spam daily:**\n\n**\"We offer website design services. Are you interested?\"**\n\nThis won’t work.  \nIt’s what everyone else sends.  \nAnd you’ll end up in spam.\n\n**So what’s the move?**\n\nTie your offer to **ROI**.\n\nHere’s a framework:\n\n1. Use Clay (or another tool) to check if they’re running ads or not\n2. Use Meta Ads Library or any ad-tracking API to find the page they’re sending traffic to.\n3. Use a tool like similar web to see how many traffic they have per month.\n4. Email them with a **conversion optimisation** offer.\n\n# Example Positioning For This Service:\n\n**\"I see you’re running ads on Meta and sending over 10,000 visits to your landing page. I had a quick look and I’ve got a few ideas that could lift your conversion rate by at least 1%.\"**\n\n**\"Would you like me to share those suggestions with you? You can implement them yourself, or we can help if you prefer.\"**\n\nThat’s it.\n\nNow he sees an **opportunity to make more money**.  \nYou’re still selling the same service, but the positioning is different.\n\nYou didn’t talk about **what** you do, you talked about **how** it can help him achieve what he already needs.\n\n**Reminder:**  \nNobody cares about your offer.  \nThey care about how it helps them.\n\nOnce you get the reply, just do the work.  \nSend real recommendations. No fluff. No generic advice. People can see right through this.\n\nAnd make sure your **website has proof**:\n\n* Case studies\n* Before &amp; after examples\n* Actual landing pages you’ve worked on etc.\n\nIf they see value, they’ll respond. Simple.\n\n# 📊 Then, track your cold email funnel:\n\n1. How many emails sent to get a positive reply.\n2. How many positive replies recommendations sent.\n3. How many recommendations sent to book get 1 booked call.\n4. How many calls you had to close 1 client.\n\nNow you know how many emails it takes to close one client. By just looking on how many emails sent till you closed 1 client.\n\nThat’s your acquisition cost from cold email.\n\n**Then scale it. Increase volume. Optimize your numbers.**\n\n**That’s it.**\n\nI learned most of this from **Daniel Fazio,** especially the difference between demand gen and demand capture.\n\nIf this is interesting to you, go look him up. He drops pure gold.",

      "selftext": "A few years ago I was struggling to generate leads\n\nI sent hundreds of cold emails and barely got replies\n\nWhen someone did respond, it was usually:\n\n\"Not interested.\" or \"Who are you?\"\n\nThen, I figured out a simple framework.\n\nAfter tweaking my approach, I started landing consistent meetings with dream clients.\n\nThe best part?\n\nIt was repeatable\n\nHere’s the exact 7 step cold email framework that changed everything for me:\n\n1.The Trigger (Why You’re Reaching Out)\n\nCold emails fail when they feel random People need context\n\nIf you don’t give them a clear reason they’ll ignore you\n\nHere’s what works:\n\n\\-They just hired a bunch of people\n\n\\-Their company raised funding\n\n\\-They got promoted\n\nExample:\n\n\"Hey Sam, saw you brought on 4 new SDRs in the past 6 months.\"\n\nNow they know why you’re reaching out\n\n2. The Implication (Why This Matters)\n\nOnce they know why you’re emailing, they need to know why they should care.\n\nIf they hired new SDRs, what might be on their mind?\n\n\\-Onboarding them quickly\n\n\\-Getting them to quota faster\n\nExample:\n\n\"Figured you might be looking into how to ramp them up quickly.\"\n\nNow, they’re thinking: “Yeah, that’s actually a priority right now.”\n\n3. The Pain (What’s Holding Them Back)\n\nPeople don’t respond to emails that just pitch a solution\n\nThey respond to emails that remind them of a painful problem\n\nIf they just hired SDRs their struggles might be:\n\n\\-Training takes too long\n\n\\-They’re not closing deals fast enough\n\n\\-The team is missing quota\n\nExample:\n\n\"Most sales leaders struggle to get new reps ramped in under 5 months.\"\n\nIf that’s their pain, they’ll feel it when they read your email.\n\n4. The Cost of Inaction (Why This Matters NOW)\n\nHere’s a secret:\n\nPeople are twice as likely to take action when they’re afraid of losing something vs gaining something\n\nMost cold emails focus on ROI (increase revenue, grow pipeline, etc.)\n\nInstead show them what they’re losing if they don’t fix the problem\n\nExample:\n\n\"Last year, 65% of sales teams missed quota due to slow onboarding\"\n\nNow, they’re thinking: “Wait, this could be happening to me.”\n\n5. Social Proof (Show, Don’t Tell)\n\nNobody wants to be the first to try something\n\nShow them you’ve already helped companies like them\n\nExample:\n\n\"We helped Gong’s reps ramp in under 3 months.\"\n\nNow, the see proof that this is possible for them too\n\n6. The Solution (But Keep It Short)\n\nHere’s where most people mess up:\n\nThey over-explain their product\n\nCold emails should create curiosity, not overwhelm the reader\n\nExample:\n\n\"We have a coaching framework that makes this 2x faster.\"\n\nThat’s it. No long paragraphs. Just enough to get them to reply\n\n7. The Soft Ask (Start a Conversation)\n\nMost cold emails fail at the CTA\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they ask for too much upfront\n\nInstead of pushing for a meeting ask a low friction question\n\nExample:\n\n\"If we could cut your ramp time in half, would that be worth a quick chat?\"\n\nNo pressure. Just an easy “yes” or “no.”\n\nHere’s What a Great Cold Email Looks Like:\n\nHey Sam,\n\nSaw you recently hired 4 new SDRs.\n\nFigured you might be looking into how to ramp them up quickly\n\nMost sales leaders struggle to get reps productive in under 5 months\n\nLast year 65% of sales teams missed quota because of slow onboarding\n\nWe helped Gong’s reps get fully ramped in under 3 months\n\nIf we could do the same for you, would that be worth a quick chat?\n\nThis simple structure has booked me hundreds of meetings\n\nThanks For Reading!",

Set other stuff like company size, location, etc.\n\n**Step 3:** pull fresh leads every single day.

Means absolutely nothing once they're on the phones.\nAfter years of headaches, here's my real-world filter:\nOne- I stopped caring about where they worked. Had a guy (ex-SAP) who couldn't hack it, then hired a barista with zero sales experience and nothing but good English and willingness to learn, he crushed it. Experience is BS (someeetimeeeessss)\nInstead, I give them a real scenario: \"Here's Company X, they just raised funding, switched CRMs, and they’re rapidly growing . What's your play?\" The ones who get creative instead of just saying \"I'd send them an email about our services\" are worth talking to.\n\nSecond - a followup separates the professionals from the amateurs. When a prospect says \"we're good\" - that's where real SDRs earn their money. I literally ask candidates \"what would you do if someone says they're all set?\" The mediocre ones say they'd \"circle back in a few months.\" The good ones have specific, value-add tactics ready to go.\nThird- I was paying way too much. My best performers now? They're from smaller shops where they had to work twice as hard for half the recognition. (Ps: we don’t overwork anyone)\n\nBonus tip that saved my budget: Give them work-life balance. Don’t bombard them with emails and texts after working hours, reimburse them when overtime is needed. Don’t be the butthole boss\n\nAnyone else feel like hiring SDRs is just expensive gambling, or just me?",

      "title": "As a Decision Maker, This Cold Email Agency Owner Lost My Business Before We Even Spoke. Here's Why.",
      "selftext": "I had an experience recently that I think serves as a potent reminder of how easily a potential client can be turned off, especially when you're selling services that hinge on personalization and smooth processes. I'm sharing this because, as someone who's been in the game for nearly two decades, these are the details that matter.\n\nFor context: I'm a former marketing executive, now a marketing consultant. Over my 20-year career, I've sat in the decision-maker's chair countless times, interviewing and hiring a wide spectrum of agencies.\n\nI'm currently serving as a fractional CMO for a small IT company. One of my key initiatives is to build out a cold email outreach program. Since the internal team doesn't have the bandwidth, I'm considering hiring a specialized cold email agency.\n\nThis week, I decided to reach out to someone I'd seen frequently on various marketing subreddits (including this one). He often posts generic (but generally sound) cold email tips and tricks. He posts from different profiles sometimes, but the style is usually a dead giveaway. Still, as a marketer, I respect the hustle. His content suggested he at least understood the fundamentals of cold email, so I figured a conversation was worthwhile.\n\nIt went sideways when I sent a DM asking for a meeting to discuss his cold email agency services. His response? Essentially, \"Here's a link to my site, book a meeting yourself.\" (I'm paraphrasing slightly, but that was the gist).\n\nOkay, let's pause here. This is a red flag because I'm reaching out about cold email services. The cornerstone of effective cold email is the effort to create a genuine connection and a seamless transition from initial contact to a meaningful conversation. Sending me to his homepage – not even a direct Calendly link – to do the legwork felt dismissive and, frankly, lazy. It immediately signaled a potential disconnect between what he preaches (personalized outreach) and what he practices. If anyone on my teams had ever handled a warm lead that way, they'd be sent straight back into retraining.\n\nDespite this, I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he was swamped. Maybe a Reddit DM doesn't register as a serious lead for him (though, why be active there if not to generate leads?).\nSo, I navigated his site, found the contact page (which, surprise, led to a Calendly link), and clicked to schedule.\n\nRed flag #2 is what really killed any interest. His Calendly page greeting was written in ALL CAPS and screamed something like: \"DON'T BOOK IF YOU'RE GOING TO WASTE MY TIME WITH WINDOW SHOPPING.\"\n\nWow... Okay...\n\nThis told me two critical things:\nFirst, Immaturity: This kind of aggressive, unprofessional language immediately signals that he's likely difficult to work with and defensive.\n\nPoor Business Acumen: As a consultant, I pitch constantly. Of course, some prospects are \"window shopping\" or primarily focused on pricing initially. That's part of the sales process! I've won many great clients who started the conversation that way. To preemptively accuse potential clients of wasting his time is incredibly shortsighted.\n\nIn this scenario, I was the ideal lead:\n - I initiated contact.\n - I had a clear need (and stated it).\n - I had the budget.\n - I had the intent to hire.\n\nThis should have been a slam-dunk for him. Instead, he introduced significant friction and planted major doubts before we even had a chance to speak. He made it harder for me to give him business.\n\nSo my advice to all you agency owners out there is first to practice what you preach: If you sell personalization, be personal. Second make it easy for leads: Reduce friction at every step, especially for warm inquiries. A direct link to your booking page is a minimum. Be professional always: Your public-facing materials, including your booking page, are an extension of your brand. Hostility is never a good look. Remember, even \"window shoppers\" can become buyers or referrers.\n\nHope this perspective from \"the other side of the table\" is helpful!",

      "title": "Why Your Purely Commission-Based Offers Are Approached By People Who Can't Do Sales and Why Legit Agencies Don't Take Those Offers",
      "selftext": "Note: This is not written by me, this post is written by u/Radiant-Security-347 and I'm posting it here because I've been noticing a large amount of commission-based offers in this subreddit. I have taken the permission to post this. He has been in the industry for more than 37 years, and I completely agree with him on this topic. This was initially posted on r/agency.\n\nNow, to the actual topic:\n\nEvery few weeks someone pops up here pitching the same “risk-free partnership” model. You know the one. They want agencies to work on commission or revenue share so “we all win together.” No budget, no retainer, no operating capital. Just trust me bro.\n\nHere’s the uncomfortable truth. These deals almost never work for either side. The odds of getting a competent, experienced agency to sign on to an arrangement like this are basically zero.\n\nNo successful firm is going to loan money in the form of labor, expertise and operating overhead to a stranger’s business when they already have paying clients. **For every dollar in cost an agency carries, they’ve got to earn three to five times more just to break even.**\n\nNobody with a real business takes that bet.\n\nSo who agrees to these deals? The unsophisticated, the brand-new and the desperate. And there’s a reason they’re desperate: they aren’t yet good at what they do. Pair inexperience with a client who wants free labor and everyone goes down together. It’s a slow-motion train wreck For both trains.\n\nAnd this is before you factor in how a performance-based model is supposed to work.\n\n1. The client funds the operating costs from day one so the agency is only risking profit, not survival.\n2. KPIs have to be clearly defined and entirely within the control of the marketing team.\n3. When those KPIs are hit, the agency earns profit plus a healthy premium for taking on risk. (Yes, the client ends up paying more).\n4. Calls for audit rights, enforcement provisions, revenue-allocation rules, attribution controls, and all the legal scaffolding that makes the deal enforceable. None of that is cheap or simple.\n\nMeanwhile the agency is expected to pay salaries, contractors, tools and ad budget until the client pays out. That assumes the client doesn’t delay, pull budget halfway through, pivot strategy, second-guess every creative decision, or insist their cousin’s ideas override the plan.\n\nThe agency has no control over any of that. Yet their compensation depends entirely on results shaped by forces outside their hands.\n\nTo make one of these things viable, the risk premium would have to be massive and the agency would need investor-level authority. They’d practically have to run the client’s business, set pricing, dictate budget, choose channels, and approve every operational decision. And that, obviously, is never going to happen.\n\nSo instead both sides pretend the math works until it doesn’t. And when it doesn’t, the client still got all that free work and the agency goes in the hole.\n\nYou also see the next layer of pain when deals finally materialize. The client will argue that certain sales “don’t count” because their internal team brought them in. Except marketing touches everything. If you don’t pay on all revenue driven during the engagement, the whole attribution model collapses. This is why these contracts are long, expensive and litigation-prone.\n\nUnderneath it all is one simple fact. Any company pushing this arrangement is either inexperienced, struggling or both. If they were doing well they’d just pay. Paying is easy. Not paying requires mental gymnastics and a willingness to shift risk onto someone else’s balance sheet.\n\nI know Hormozi says “work for free at first“ but he’s never actually run an agency. I’ve been running my own agency longer than he’s been alive. And he doesn’t give a shit if you lose everything.\n\nFlat fees and defined KPIs are simple, fair and stable. They require the client to exercise discernment in who they hire and the humility to let the expert lead. That’s the part many of these “partners” seem unwilling to do.\n\nIf you’re considering one of these deals, save yourself the headache. The numbers don’t lie. The risk doesn’t lie. And the pattern never changes. It’s a sucker’s bet every time.",

I've been charging them this for at least 18 months and they've been paying it no problem. I recently wanted to increase my rate so I went and looked at the contract I signed and it says $40/hour. I did in fact charge them $40/hour for the first few months - then I apparently just changed it to $45, without asking or proposing or anything. $45 was what I was charging other clients and I guess I got confused, then I just used the last invoice as the template going forwards. Nobody noticed. What should I do about this? Can they claw back the money somehow? I assume not - I'd just stop working for them if they tried that...but I like working for them and I don't want to be dishonest. I also want to increase my rate to $55, on the basis that I haven't changed it in 2 years (except, of course, I actually have!)\n\nI'm a technical content writer and editor.\n\nUPDATE: Thanks for all your (incredibly diverse) opinions. I'm going to mention it to them because I'm sure they'll be basically fine with it and it's only right to be honest and upfront. But I also consulted a lawyer friend who said \"It's a variation of the contract by conduct - you're fine\". So if it came to it (it won't) they wouldn't be able to claw back the money - and I'm certainly not going to offer to do so.\n\nUPDATE 2: I told them and it's all sorted out. They were as confused as I was. They said they knew what my rate was and I told them it said 40 on my invoice and they just said \"we can issue you a new invoice if you like but it's not required\". When I first started I quoted 45 and they said can we start at 40 and we'll see how we go, sort of thing. Obviously I forgot that conversation and when I messed up six months later (due to starting a new invoice when away from my desktop - I know, I know, my invoices are now all online) they just accepted it. Anyway, I'm going to 55 next month. Thanks for all your replies and sorry if I was rude to any of you - I don't agree that I did anything that bad or that they are now owed that money. I'm sloppy, clearly, but I'm not dishonest and at the end of the day it's my work that matters to them. And legally there's no question about it - they accepted my invoices, which means a variation of the contract by conduct. As I said, I consulted a contract lawyer.",

No acknowledgement of scope creep or value.\n\nInstead of paying, they stalled. Dismissed my emails. Tried to bully me into silence and extort my original working files with vehement refusal to pay my invoice. I was told I was grossly overcharging for my time and the work completed was not approved. They were trying to rewrite the narrative of this story to excuse the bad behaviour demonstrated at my expense. \n\nI filed a Small Claims Court case.\n\nAnd I want to say this — because I know a lot of women here will understand:\n\nWe get praised when we’re agreeable, fast, and “team players.”\nBut when we draw a line professionally, legally and with boundaries — suddenly we’re “hard to work with.”\n\nWell, I’ve stopped worrying about being palatable. And I know the calibre of my work is excellent. \n\nI’m not sharing this for revenge.\nI’m sharing it because:\n\n1) Too many professional women in freelance, contract or creative roles are exploited by disorganized and/or male-dominated team. \n\n2) We’re expected to deliver premium work — and in return get ghosted or gaslit.\n\n3) We’re supposed to be “grateful” instead of being compensated.\n\nNo more.\n\nDocument your work. Stand up for your rates. File when you have to.\nSilence is what they’re counting on. And it’s the one thing I’m no longer offering.\n\nI’m still in the middle of the claim process, but I already know I did the right thing. And I hope if someone here needs the push to do the same — you take this as your sign.\n\nYou and your work are worth so much more than you will be acknowledged for — or paid for. \n\n….\n\nQuick Update June 13th:\n\nClient still refused to pay … ( deflection then silence — even after being served! ) but using my work in a new paid social ad campaign. \n\nAs mentioned above, I filed a Small Claims Court case after a client refused to pay an invoice for creative direction, marketing plans, design and photography.\n\nToday, an ad came up in my feed. They’re running Facebook ads using my work — creative direction, photography and language/tone from the unpaid project. \n\nThey tried to condition payment on my handing over my working files, and now they’re commercially benefiting from the work while refusing to pay. It’s not right. \n\nAgain, If you’re doing creative, strategy, or freelance work: protect yourself. Keep records. Don’t assume good faith. And if it comes to it, use the legal system — it exists for this exact reason.\n\n",

      "selftext": "**Sleep**\n\nOften, I can't sleep for shit. I'm in my late 30s and it's never improved.\n\nI could maybe force a 8:30am rise but then I'm too tired to work. Today, I got up at 11am, and that's fine.\n\nI've read something about a caveman gene where some of us are programmed to stay up and watch the cave. I think I'm a cave watcher.\n\n**Focus**\n\nMy focus is all over the fucking place. I can hyper-focus, but it's not on what I should be doing. In other words, I procrastinate like a mother fucker.\n\nThe cave would be fucked because I'd get distracted by a badger or something.\n\nI bought a book on overcoming procrastination and never read it.\n\nI'm less pleased with these traits but again, it's fine.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nI'll hit periods where I need a few days off. I can't explain it honestly I just have zero motivation. So I do.\n\nBut I do it knowing my work labido will return. I've been through it enough. I don't let it bother me.\n\nThat's also fine.\n\n**Employers would run a mile**\n\nCan you imagine if I led with this when applying for a job?\n\nI mean, I wouldn't mention it, because you can't, but it should be more acceptable. Especially the sleep thing. Throughout the course of a given month I'll do just as well (maybe better?) as your average Joe.\n\n**Thank fuck for freelance**\n\nMy savior.\n\nI pay tax twice, don't get any benefits and would like to earn more, but as a job I LOVE it.\n\nLuckily, I charge $60-75/hour so even if I work 10 days it's enough. For now anyway, but it's within my hands to grow and earn more.\n\nI can also largely choose what to work on based on what I fancy that day/week.\n\nI'm free. I don't need your cave.\n\nClients don't know if I'm working, having a wank or going for a walk. It's none of their business anyway. I deliver each month and know my shit so, again, it's fine.\n\n**Talk to me**\n\nAnyway, I'd be interested in hearing if this resonates with anyone and/or what your day/week looks like and how you've learnt to improve.\n\nSorry if this has been posted before. It's difficult to search for \"is anyone else a fucking mess\" or similar!\n\nThanks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: To those PMing me RE freelance advice I'm sorry but I don't think I'm the person to speak to.\n\nFeel free to start a thread and message me about it and I'll comment though. At least then people can call me out if I'm giving bad advice (which is entirely possible if not likely!).",

Most listings sound like an invoice.\n\n“4 bed, 5 bath, quartz countertops.”\nMeanwhile the top agents are out here selling **privacy, views, status, legacy, peace, lifestyle**.\nOne agent literally said:\n\n“You’re selling the *feeling* of walking through the door at sunset… not the square footage.”\n\n2. Wealthy clients judge you BEFORE they meet you.\n\nNot on your suit.\nNot on your car.\n**On your marketing.**\nIf your digital presence feels “average,” they assume your service is “average.”\nHigh net worth people are allergic to average.\n\n\n3. The *first click* is the first showing.\n\nThis one hit me.\nRealtors spend $$$ on staging the home…\n…but send buyers an ugly MLS link as the first impression.\nOne agent said:\n\n“Why would I stage a $6M home but send it out like a Craigslist ad?”\n\nOuch.\n\n\n 4. Luxury buyers investigate quietly.\n\nThey don’t comment.\nThey don’t “inquire for more info.”\nThey stalk your materials, make an instant judgment, and move on if it doesn’t feel premium.\nYou won’t even know you lost them.\n\n\n5. Everyone said the same pain point.\n\n“I *want* my listings to look cinematic and polished but I don’t have the time, designers, or tech team to build custom pages.”\n\nAt the luxury level, Canva templates don’t cut it.\n\n 6. The biggest myth?\n\n“Luxury is about more exposure.”\nNope.\n“It’s about the *right* exposure, packaged *flawlessly*.”\nOne agent told me:\n\n“I don’t need 100,000 views. I need the right 8 people to feel something.”\n\nHope this helps someone\n\n*Asked AI to help edit the notes, didn’t realize it would be so triggering* m dashes are for winners and I’m not ashamed to use them 🥹",

      "title": "What I’ve learned after years of doing online marketing for Realtors",
      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I recently joined Reddit and figured I would start providing value to the communities I care about from the start.\n\nI’ve been in the Real Estate Online Marketing space for a couple of years now. And have successfully built a marketing agency that helps Real Estate Agents and Team Owners secure leads, nurture these leads and ultimately close more deals.\n\nHere’s what’s worked for my clients. (Mind you I’m located in what most consider to be the most competitive market for Realtors)\n\n**1. Google Ads PPC (pay per lead):** yes, these work. The reason why they work is because you are able to target specific things people are searching for. It’s not like Meta Ads where you target a topic or interest. Here you target the exact search. So if you want show up for “coastal homes in X” you can do that.\n\nCost: you can see some results with as little as $500/ month on ad spent\n\nPROS:\n\n* hyper specific targeting.\n* meet your leads where they are at, instead of shooting darts in the dark with meta ads\n* access unique leads\n\nCONS:\n\n* will produce a ton of “duds” (leads with fake info, just browsing or will never reply to you) this comes with the territory\n* can get pricey if you don’t know what you’re doing\n* complex to set up, you need a pro to do it right\n\n**2. Google LSA (local service ad):** these are awesome. Instead of paying per click you pay per lead.\n\nPROS:\n\n* higher quality lead\n* lower sales cycle\n\nCONS:\n\n* requires Google My Business Verification which for some is tough to get\n* can be pricey depending on where you are at\n\nCost: commonly between $20-$60 per lead\n\n**3. Follow Up:** “Money is in the Follow Up” building a system for messaging leads with quality messages for a long time will make you money. Straight up. BUT PLEASE do not use templated drip campaigns that are sterile. It’s a slap to the face for your lead. You’re trying to help them figure out what could be their biggest life decision. A simple “just checking in, are you ready to buy/sell?” Won’t cut it.\n\nDo use technology to make your life easier. I suggest either having a CRM to track everything for you or investing in software that does it for you.\n\nPROS:\n\n* as close as you can get to guaranteed income\n* referral opportunities\n\nCONS\n\n* it’s a ton of work\n* misleading solutions: most auto follow up/ nurturing systems hurt you more than benefit you as they use stale, generic messaging that annoy leads\n\n**4. Reputation Management + Google My Business:** Create a system to request reviews and get as many as you need in your area to surpass your biggest competitor. Reply to every review as fast as you can and update your profile frequently with new photos. You can use listing photos or better yet “just sold” photos.\n\nPROS:\n\n* it’s FREE\n* biggest ROI out of any other activity by FAR\n* secure steady stream of high quality leads\n\nCONS\n\n* slow to get traction as getting reviews takes time\n* constant upkeep\n\n**5. BONUS: (not online) OPEN HOUSES**\n\nI work with the biggest names in California. They all say “if I was a new agent starting out I would hold every Open House I could get my hands on and the follow up with all leads constantly with care”\n\nThat’s it!\n\nNow here’s a quick list of things that don’t work as well:\n\n1. SEO. Top 15 searches are dominated by Zillow, Redfin, etc. Trying to 1 up them is too costly. Spend your marketing dollars elsewhere.\n2. “What to do in XYZ Town this weekend” these don’t work anymore. Back in boomer days it did but now everyone is offering their Chat GPT calendar of events and it’s become too saturated.\n3. First homebuyers downloadable guide. Don’t be lazy, offer an actual sit down consult with potential homebuyers. Get them a coffee while you’re at it, they’ll love you.\n\nThat’s all I can think of right now.\n\nLet’s open the discussion, do you have any questions about any of these? Have you used them in the past and if so did they work? Need help understanding any of these?\n\nLet me know in the comments, this is my first post of many. I’m always looking at giving back to the community!\n\n(Please let me know if this is the right subreddit to post this in)",

      "selftext": "So the same law firms that went after NAR are now targeting Zillow for their Flex program, claiming they “trick” buyers into using Zillow agents who pay up to 40% referral fees - and buyers have no idea this is happening. \n\nHere’s what really gets me: when buyers click “Contact Agent” on a listing, they think they’re reaching the listing agent. Instead, they get connected to a Zillow Flex agent who’s already committed to paying Zillow 40% of their commission. \n\nThink about that for a second. The buyer thinks they’re getting connected to someone who can help them negotiate a better price. But really, they’re getting an agent who needs every penny they can squeeze out of the deal because they’re giving nearly half their commission to Zillow.\n\nThe lawsuit claims this keeps commissions artificially high because “the buyer Flex agent is receiving such a paltry sum in return,” so sellers end up paying more to compensate. \n\nWhat bothers me most is the lack of transparency when we just went through this. Buyers deserve to know when their “recommended” agent is paying a massive referral fee that might affect how hard they negotiate on their behalf.\n\nI’ve always believed that if you’re good at this business, you shouldn’t need to pay 40% to a portal for leads. Build your own referral network. Create your own content. Develop relationships with past clients who actually know and trust you.\n\nBut here’s my real question for everyone: How many of you have clients who found you through Zillow, and did they have any idea you were paying a referral fee (if you did)? Did it change how you approached their transaction at all?\n\nWhat’s y’all’s take on this?",

Like a total fraud  \n∙ Everyone looks like they know what they're doing.

      "selftext": "This just happened last week and I'm still processing how badly I screwed this up. I had an operations manager who knew everything about how we run things. Client onboarding process, how to handle edge cases, all the workflows, everything. She'd been with me for 3 years. She gave two weeks notice. Very professional, nothing dramatic. Just got a better opportunity. During those two weeks I realized we had ZERO training materials. Nothing written down. No videos. No knowledge base. Just her brain. We tried to do knowledge transfer. She wrote some notes. We recorded a few Zoom calls where she explained things. But you can't download 3 years of knowledge in two weeks. She left. And now everything takes 3x longer because nobody knows how she did things. We're figuring it out but it's painful. Clients are asking \"\"why is this taking so long now?\"\" and I have to explain that the person who knew how to do it quickly doesn't work here anymore. The worst part: This was completely preventable. I knew for 3 years that all this knowledge was only in one person's head. I knew I should be documenting things. I just never made it a priority because it felt like busywork compared to actually running the business. Now I'm trying to build training materials from scratch while also trying to keep operations running and it's a nightmare. Creating a knowledge base from nothing while you're already overwhelmed is way harder than building it incrementally over time. I'm spending 15-20 hours this week creating training materials I should have created over the past 3 years. Time is everything right now so I'm using notion for process docs, gamma for visual guides, claude to help draft things faster - basically whatever lets me create something that looks presentable without taking forever. Can't afford to spend days perfecting each document when I need dozens of them immediately. If you have people on your team who know critical things: Document that knowledge NOW. Before they leave. Before they get sick. Before something happens that makes you wish you had done this earlier. Learn from my expensive mistake.\"",

      "selftext": "So yeah, I made around $45,000 last year creating and running a couple of AI characters online. And no, I’m not some social media guru or full-time content creator—I’m a software dev who just got curious and decided to mess around.\n\nI didn’t think it would go anywhere at first. It started as a random side project, just something fun to work on after hours. But after a few months of testing things out, it actually started to grow—and turn into real income.\n\n⸻\n\nWhere It Started\n\nOne night I came across an AI influencer on Instagram. I figured it was just a model with heavy filters, but nope—fully generated, and honestly pretty impressive.\n\nI got hooked. Spent a few hours scrolling, then the next few nights going down the rabbit hole. Watched some YouTube tutorials, fired up Stable Diffusion, and started experimenting.\n\nThe images were rough at first. A lot of weird hands, blurry eyes, and deleted posts. But I wasn’t trying to go viral or perfect anything—I just wanted to build something that felt cool.\n\nEventually, I created my first character, Lina. Then came Sasha. I gave them loose storylines and slightly different vibes to keep things interesting. They weren’t super deep characters or anything, but enough to keep people curious and coming back.\n\n⸻\n\nTools I Used\n\nI didn’t overthink it. Here’s the basic stack I used: • Fooocus (RunDiffusion at first, then locally) • Juggernaut V9, Lyuyang Mix • Photoshop and Topaz for cleanup • ChatGPT/GPT-4 for captions and responses • Patreon and Fanvue for monetization\n\nNothing super technical. Honestly, if you can Google and experiment, you can figure this out.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat Worked\n\nPosting consistently was the main thing. I didn’t try to game the algorithm or spam reels—I just focused on solid visuals, decent captions, and showing up often enough for people to notice.\n\nAlso, once I started offering private content behind a paywall (nothing explicit—just more personal/curated stuff), I saw a big shift. That’s when the income really started rolling in.\n\nFanvue did better than Patreon, but both had their place. I also brought on someone part-time to help with chatting and replies, which made a surprising difference.\n\n⸻\n\nThe Earnings\n\nHere’s what it looked like over the year: • Lina on Fanvue: $18,790 • Lina on Patreon: $10,580 • Sasha on Fanvue: $12,880 • Sasha on Patreon: $4,900\n\nTotal: \\~$47,000\n\nAll while working my regular dev job. Honestly, it was kind of surreal.\n\n⸻\n\nWould I Recommend It?\n\nIf you’re even a little bit curious, I’d say go for it. It’s fun, weirdly satisfying, and there’s real potential here if you stick with it.\n\nYou don’t need to be a designer or know AI inside-out. You just need to be curious, willing to experiment, and okay with posting cringe until you figure out what works.\n\nLet me know if you’re thinking about starting something like this or already have—I’m happy to answer questions or talk shop in the comments.",

Classic bottleneck founder problem.\n\nHere's what I did:\n\nSpent hours writing SOPs in Notion. Nobody read them. Too long, too boring, too much text. Tried making them shorter but then they were too vague.\n\nHired someone on Upwork to create training materials. They made these generic templates that didn't actually show how WE do things. Waste of $800.\n\nBought a Udemy course on \"building systems for your business.\" Took notes. Created frameworks. Built spreadsheets. Still nobody on my team knew how to do things without asking me.\n\nThen last month I got sick. Like actually sick, couldn't work for a week. And my team just... figured stuff out. They called each other, they screen-shared, they walked each other through processes. It wasn't elegant but it worked.\n\nThat's when I realized I'd been thinking about systems completely wrong.\n\nI was trying to WRITE documentation when I should have just been SHOWING people how to do things. People don't want to read a 12-step process. They want to see someone do it once and then try it themselves.\n\nSo I stopped writing and started recording. Not fancy recordings - just screen recordings where I do the actual work and talk through what I'm doing and why. Like explaining it to someone sitting next to me.\n\nI made 15 of these in two weeks. Each one is 5-10 minutes. I used whatever tools made it fast - screen recordings with Loom for some, used Trupeer for ones that needed cleanup and written versions, some I just did on Zoom calls and saved the recordings.\n\nThe difference is insane.\n\nMy team actually watches these. I can see it in the analytics. More importantly, questions have dropped by like 60%. When someone asks how to do something, I send them the 6-minute video instead of typing out a long explanation or getting on a call.\n\nNew hires onboard way faster because they can watch me do the work instead of reading about the work.\n\nThe insight that's valuable: **Systems documentation doesn't need to be polished or comprehensive. It needs to show someone competent doing the thing while explaining their thought process.**\n\nStop trying to write the perfect SOP. Just record yourself doing your job for a week and narrate what you're doing. That's your documentation.\n\nYou don't need a course on building systems. You don't need to hire someone. You don't need fancy tools. You need to hit record and do your actual work while explaining it.\n\nI spent six months overthinking this when I could have just shown people how I do things. Hopefully you're smarter than me and don't waste half a year on it.\n\n",

Or launch it and get no customers.\n\n\n\n**Startups are truthfully a numbers game.** Even the best founders have hit rates under 10%. Just look at founders like Peter Levels.\n\n\n\nSo how do you maximize your chances of success, the honest answer is to increase the number of startups you launch.\n\n\n\nI’m going to get hate for this: but you should NOT spend hundreds of hours building a product… until you know for certain that there is demand.\n\n\n\nYou should launch with just a landing page.\n\n\n\nWrite a one pager on what you will build, and use a completely free UI library like Magic UI to build a landing page.\n\n\n\nIt should take you under a day.\n\n\n\nThen what do you do?\n\n\n\nAdd a stripe checkout button and/or a book a demo button.\n\n\n\nAnd then launch.

      "selftext": "So I've been on this god forsaken platform for 15 years, ever since I'm a pimple-faced shit-eating teenager. Back in 2009, Reddit's got nothing but memes and cat pictures. For better or worse, times a changed.\n\nHere's the truth: Reddit is the best platform for business owners to test new offers, it’s the easiest way to reach hundreds and thousands of impressions for free.\n\nUnlike social media, Reddit operates without the unpredictable, black-box algorithms that runs the other platforms. Instead of chasing elusive virality, you can connect directly with niche communities, talk to your customers directly to get real actionable feedback. Let’s put all that aside for now, and I’ll walk you through exactly how to find your first client on Reddit.\n\nI'll walk you step by step on how to stop being a lurker and start posting like a pro on this platform, where average well performing post will get you 100K+ plus impressions and hundreds of leads.\n\nBut you need to know how and where to write engaging content that people loves to read first:\n\n1. Find the relevant subreddit with your target audience via tools like gummy search.\n2. Spend one to two weeks visiting the subreddit every day. Sort by “New”, and look for patterns in posts, usually people will post about the same things.\n3. Spend all of your time on perfecting the post title, be punchy and follow similar formats BUT be unique. This is one chance to make your offer stand out.\n4. DO NOT sell in the post content, keep it very short. Tell a story or speak your truth.\n5. Reply between posts, use sarcasm and be funny.\n\nOK, so how do you use Reddit as a lead-gen machine?\n\nUse Reddit as the top of the funnel, work in keywords that are relevant to your product or services. Don’t forget to add links to your profile, this is how people will find out more about you and your offer. I would directly add any buy links and social media links here if you have any.\n\nDon’t be afraid to delete posts that are not working, and make sure you don’t stack too many similar posts together. People WILL check your post history (it’s usually the first thing they do) and they’ll dismiss you if your post history seems spammy.\n\nI would sprinkle in non business types of posts throughout, what are your interests? There’s most likely already a subreddit for that and just comment/post in it occasionally. I recommend 1 business post for every 3-4 interest posts would be a good ratio.\n\nMy goal is to test one new tactic per quarter and reuse the ones that already works. You should try these out and make them your own.\n\nStrategy breakdown\n\nSpend **30 days** exploring and consuming content in target subreddits.\n\nThen, Post weekly to engage your audience, allow **additional 30-60** days of progress:\n\n1. **Automoderator deleting your post:** Check the automod comment, make sure you aren’t using banned keywords.\n2. **Moderators deleting your post (rules):** Check the deletion reason, usually because you’ve broke some rule or people being jerks reporting your content. Either way, bend the knee and try again.\n3. **No engagement (test post time, post title):** Try different post times, sort by top post in a subreddit for the week and look at when they were posted. Then spend time iterating on the post title, a catchy title is really important.\n4. **Downvotes or negative comments (test post content):** This step is key: refine your posts, tell better stories, stay patient, and engage in the comments. Use all negative signal as learning.\n5. **Viral 150K+ post with hundreds of comments:** You should get here within 90s days if you iterated and tested everything above.\n\nGoogle❤️ Reddit\n\nI'm an avid hockey fan and my team is the Toronto Maple Leafs, if you search for one of our player (last name Matthews) on Google, you'll see a picture of his mug as the top result, but something is off.\n\nSome genius recently went viral on Reddit (in r/leafs) with a photoshopped image of him with fake hair.\n\nGoogle placed it front and centre on the results page (for real, just search \"matthews\"). The Reddit post with 1.5K upvotes is a meme titled “Auston Matthews has returned from Europe after receiving treatment for his undisclosed upper-body issue”.\n\nThis confirms that Reddit is great for SERP results and a well performing post can get your brand to the top of Google search results with any keyword (in the post title).\n\nI’m actively exploring ways to leverage this to help product companies market their products and get boosted on Google search results. It’s super powerful.\n\n# But does Reddit ACTUALLY sell? The answer is YES.\n\nLet me tell you the story of how I came across a comment late 2023 while looking up how to make a custom engagement ring. I search Google for “jeweller recommendation canada reddit”, the post was the second result on the first SERP. After reading a few comments, I decided to reach out to the blacksmith. A few month later I got the ring in the mail and used it to propose to my girlfriend, we couldn’t be happier.\n\n$5,000+ purchase decision made based on:\n\n* A top Google result\n* Reddit comments and review, validating the seller\n\nBy this point you HAVE to purposefully provide a bad experience for me to look for an alternative. Reddit + Google search results + Community review = WIN\n\nOK but what actual results do you have to show for all this?\n\nCheck my post history. I've got multiple near top voted posts of all time in this sub, and those posts got me hundreds of leads and booked dozens of calls with prospects. I ended up closing multiple clients last year directly from those posts I made.\n\nSo how do I start?\n\nFor the next 90 days, just post about what you do, where you want to go, how you going to achieve it. It won't take you a long time trust me I've been there.",

Write in 1 text! If you write 5 texts, in Reddit you only see the last one before opening the chat.\n6. Ideally show some validation, traction. Even showing successful competitors helps.\n7. Dont expect the investor to respond right away, they have their own life outside of social media.\n8. DONT EVEN DM before you have posted your idea publicly, best and most honest feedback is literally down here in the comment section. \n9. And lastly, THERE IS 0% CHANCE SOMEONE STEALS YOUR IDEA.\n\nEDITEDIT!\nForgot to add the most important one.\n10. State the reason why are you pursuing the idea in the first place. Can be measured in monetary value, can be your personal ambitions, can be something beautiful.",

      "selftext": "Very curious to hear other peoples perspective.\n\nI did some consulting for this Single Family Office 2 years ago, we had a full contract signed and everything. One thing that just annoyed me at the time, it was that the location of jurisdiction was based in Switzerland, instead of being based here in the US. I let it kind of slide, not assuming I would get stiffed.\n\nA year passed, and honestly, I didn’t really need the money. The agreement was that he would pay me $25,000 a month as a retainer, plus a percentage on the back end of deals, to help him take a company public and make key introductions. At first, when I brought up payment, he kept saying he’d pay me in one lump sum in 3–4 months. I was fine with it—I wasn’t pressed. But over time, he kept claiming he wasn’t liquid and was waiting for a big cash-out. Eventually, I realized he was just stringing me along and taking advantage of my time. I formally walked away. I had treated this role like a board seat—limited time commitment but still valuable. In the end, I got played because I was too nice.\n\n**Fast forward two years**, and now I’m just pissed that I wasted a whole year dealing with this ridiculous person. He still texts me with the same nonsense—“I’m getting it done, I’m getting it done.” At this point, it’s beyond frustrating; it’s straight-up disrespectful. It’s not even about the money anymore—it’s the principle. I got screwed over and lied to my face, and that’s what really bothers me.\n\nTaking legal action against someone in Switzerland is actually a pain in the ass, and I'm not sure what i want to spend $200k to get $400k.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar?

      "title": "How My Failed Startup Changed My Life",
      "selftext": "Not sure why, but I’ve been reflecting today on how my 2.5 years building a startup (2021-2023) that eventually failed completely changed my life.\n\nA bit of background: I had a comfy actuarial job for about 8 years, as a FSA. It paid well, occassinally rewarding projects, but overall monotone. I got bored out of my mind and decided to take a leap. I was lucky to raise some funding pre-product, and more throughout the journey, and spent the next couple of years trying to innovate in a really tough insurance space. I was the business cofounder.\n\nFast forward, the company failed, and I took full responsbility.\n\nI walked away with:\n\n* 2.5 years of minimal pay\n* zero equity\n* a strained relationship with my cofounder (also my best friend) but later amended\n* disappointed investors who saw us as the big bet in their portfolio\n\nAnd yet, I’d still call it the most rewarding period of my life. Here’s why:\n\n1. I learned how to actually run a business Being a cofounder forced me to operate at a much higher level than I ever did in corporate. I got to work directly with industry leaders, entrepreneurs, and partners on real deals and got to understand the dynamics I would otherwise never see. That kind of exposure would’ve taken me 20 years+, or never, to get if I’d stayed in my old job.\n2. The people Working with smart, curious, problem-solving people is addictive. The energy in startup land is completely different. In corporate, it’s meetings and middle management beating the same drums; in startups, it’s ideas flying everywhere and people who are curious and want to make things work. It’s contagious.\n3. Real leadership is built in chaos I used to think I was a decent leader. Turns out, leading in corporate is easy. You follow processes and check boxes. Leading in a startup means staying calm and collected through chaos and keeping your team level headed when everything is on fire, which is like 80%+ of the time. It humbled me fast.\n4. I found my own “product-market fit” This journey showed me what I’m good at, what I’m terrible at, and what kind of work actually energizes me and allow me to flourish now being a partnership leader that still taps into my analytical skills, and frankly, FSA still helps drive big deal through since my counterparts appreciate the analytical rigors we bring. It’s weirdly satisfying to figure that out, even if you learn it through repeated failure.\n5. Starting with my best friend was both a blessing and a curse He’s an accomplished, brilliant and shar engineer and I probably wouldn’t have started without him. But over time, it became clear that he didn’t want the 24/7 grind that startups demand. That misalignemtn deeply hurt our chances and strained our friendship. We’ve made peace since, but it was rough during the storm. You really don’t know how people (or you) will react under pressure and stress until you’re there.\n6. The good, bad, and ugly I met principled founders, loud talkers, and straight-up scammers. I learned how deals get made, how people really operate, and how to spot who’s serious. It made me sharper, more curious, and a lot less naive.\n\nWe hear so many success stories in startups. I figured I’d share the other side. The one where it doesn’t work out, but still ends up being one of the best decisions of your life.",

Designers usually send me designs in Figma.\n\nYesterday, I decided to pay for the Professional plan to access Dev Mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hjmxtbpgqjgc1.png?width=1214&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e792183d14f5187d807856481186d8ae20d8cc9e\n\nOnce I signed up for a plan, I noticed that I couldn't use the Dev Mode on most projects I work with.\n\nThere was an error telling me that I was not a member of the team:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3w04aimqjgc1.png?width=352&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3def48367dae216e9c19222866440f07e005b42\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay. I asked the designer to add me as a member of his team, but I still can't use the advertised Dev Mode:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rksbvqbrqjgc1.png?width=405&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00dc20def63fa972134c890f8e071239616f35ad\n\nSo, I would need to ask the designer to pay for an additional seat ($15/mo) to allow me to use it in the Dev Mode, which I have paid for already.\n\nThat's called a scam.\n\nTechnically, I can export the design as a FIG file and import it under my team, but in this case, I had to re-import the design to sync the changes. Also, there will be no comments, notes, and other important features.\n\nFrom this perspective, it will be easier to use [Pixso](https://pixso.net/) this way. I also need to import the Figma design, but I have access to Pixso's Dev Mode for free. Penpot is also pretty good and completely free, but the Figma import is not perfect.\n\nAs an EU resident, I have canceled my plan and requested a refund.\n\nSo if you're a freelancer, independent contractor, or an employee in a small company, don't make my mistake and do not purchase Dev Mode. It's mostly useless.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, the way how Figma sells its services can be considered a scam. The [EU Directive on consumer rights](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/shopping/contract-information/index_en.htm) requires the seller to provide a customer with **clear, correct and understandable information** about the product or service before purchase.\n\nFigma deliberately did not include this information on the [Pricing page](https://www.figma.com/pricing/), on the [Pricing FAQ page](https://www.figma.com/pricing-faq/), or during the checkout.\n\nSo yes, \"scam\" is the correct word to describe the situation.\n\nI hope my experience will be useful to you and you won't pay for the service you can't use.",

(Just to clarify, this screen isn’t the main feed—it’s the page where you can track your monthly or yearly reading count and feel that sweet sense of accomplishment.)\n\nAlso, as a Korean team, we realized vertical text felt natural to us—thanks for pointing out how it reads to everyone else! 🙏\n\nWe’ve also uploaded the movie and music UI—please take a look and let us know your honest thoughts.\n\nRepov is an app that makes it easy to record all your cultural experiences—books, movies, music, and more.
