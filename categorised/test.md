# Building a Healthcare App: What I Wish I Knew

Alright, so I'm an idiot who thought building a healthcare app would be like any other startup. **Spoiler alert:** it's not.

## Step 1: Figure out HIPAA

Thought patient data was just regular data. Nope. **$15k for compliance stuff** before I even wrote code. Now I have a 47-page document I pretend to understand.

## Step 2: Integrations

Epic wants **$25k just to talk to them**. Took 8 months to get approved. Best part? Our app crashed every time someone with an apostrophe in their name tried to log in. Thanks O'Connor.

## Step 3: Timeline

Told everyone we'd ship in 3 months. **That was 14 months ago.** Every simple feature becomes a compliance nightmare. Lost my first developer after the third audit.

## Step 4: Money disappears faster than you think

- AWS went from **$500 to $3k a month**
- Had to hire a DevOps guy at **$5k/month** because everything kept breaking
- Burned through **$220k way faster than expected**

## Step 5: User research

Spent 8 months on this beautiful interface. First doctor said it doesn't fit their workflow at all. Apparently clicking 5 times to schedule something is too much work.

**Turns out there are pre-built components for all this.** Would've saved me a year of pain and most of my money if I'd known that from the start.
