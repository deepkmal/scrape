      "selftext": "I’ve spent unreasonable amount of time with AI tools and here’s curated list of ones I recommend for productivity:\n\n# General assistants\n\n**ChatGPT** \\- You probably know it. It’s a great tool for ideating, brainstorming, document summarization and quick question-answer work.\n\nThere’s a desktop app available so you can quickly pop it up by pressing control + space, which makes it even better for productivity.\n\n**Claude** \\- Another chat interface, similar to ChatGPT.\n\nIt’s a different model provider so the answers and behavior might be different.\n\nFrom my experience, Claude 3.5 Sonnet is performing better than GPT-4o (but not o1) in tasks that focus on reasoning, code writing and copywriting.\n\nThere’s also a desktop app available.\n\n**Gemini** \\- Honestly, I’m not even sure where to put it.\n\nIt’s Google’s model, one of the most powerful in terms of multimodal capabilities (text, image, audio).\n\nAnd it’s tailored for your Google Workspace.\n\nEmail, docs, spreadsheets, meets, presentation. Anything.\n\n# Research\n\n**Perplexity** \\- Perplexity is an AI search engine that provides answers to questions with up-to-date information.\n\nSo, forget Google. Use Perplexity to get answers to questions and dive down the rabbit hole.\n\n**Exa AI** \\- Exa is another advanced search engine that combines AI-driven neural search with traditional keyword search.\n\nIt understands the semantic meaning of queries and documents.\n\nAnd you can also choose what you want to search: academic articles, news, reports, tweets etc.\n\n# Productivity\n\n**ABY Journal** \\- best AI journal so far.\n\nIf you're a person who likes writing down their thoughts, experiences and tries to become your best self, ABY will help.\n\nIt's a smart journal that provides insights into your personality, thinking patterns and dealing with your emotions to be a better you.\n\nOh, and the design is slick.\n\n**Granola** \\- Great AI notepad for meetings.\n\nIt’s a desktop app, so there’s no bot joining your meetings.\n\nIt automatically transcribes and enhances meeting notes, helping organize and summarize key takeaways and generates action items, follow-up emails, etc.\n\nIt also allows you to ask questions about the transcript and get answers.\n\n**Reclaim** \\- AI-powered calendar that optimizes for productivity.\n\nEssentially, it automates meetings, tracks tasks, and protects deep work time.\n\nCool thing is that it syncs with Google Calendar and Slack.\n\n**Cora** \\- Batch processing emails is one of the main productivity tactics.\n\nCora enables that.\n\nYou only see emails that you need to respond to.\n\nAnd it generates automatic replies for you.\n\nAll other emails are summarized twice a day.\n\n# Knowledge summarization &amp; learning\n\n**Particle News** \\- Short summaries of the daily news. Pretty straightforward.\n\n**Snitchnotes** \\- Create structured notes from study material and get personalized quizzes. Saves time if you're in college / school. \n\nI use it when I want to retain what I'm reading and prep for exams. \n\n**Notebook LM** \\- Notebook LM helps process and summarize various types of content, such as PDFs, websites, videos, and more.\n\nThe cool thing is that it provides insights and connections between topics, cites sources and offers audio summaries.\n\nI use it when the content to read is too long and I’m on the go.\n\n**Napkin** \\- For creating visuals from text.\n\nYou can easily generate and customize infographics, diagrams etc.\n\nSo, if you’re brainstorming, writing or preparing for a presentation, Napkin will work well.\n\n# Writing and brainstorming\n\n**Grammarly** \\- Well known grammar checker.\n\nIt helps improve writing by focusing on clarity and tone.\n\nSometimes the Grammarly icon popping up is annoying though.\n\n**Flow** \\- Flow helps you write and edit notes by speaking.\n\nAnd it integrates across all the apps you use, adapts to your tone and style.\n\nCool tool for just yapping!\n\n# Automations\n\n**Gumloop** \\- Think AI-first Zapier, but 100x more powerful.\n\nIt's is a platform for automating complex work using AI via a no-code drag and drop interface.\n\nIt’s very easy to automate work without needing engineers.\n\nAnd they have loads of templates.\n\nI strongly believe that technology is leverage. And with AI we can be in top 0.1% of people.\n\nIf you want bit deeper dive into the topic, I shared that on my substack (available via link in my profile)\n\nAny other recommendations for apps I could use?",

I’m usually an Arc user.\n* Shottr – Screenshot tool that’s just better than the built-in one.\n* AlDente – Lifesaver for battery health. Keeps my MacBook from charging to 100% all the time.\n* Hyperduck – Makes file sharing between devices super easy. even when your devices are offline.\n* Neetorecord – It's basically a free loom alternative, helps me avoid unnecessary meetings.\n* Brosix – Team communication app I use with my small crew. Not as hyped as Slack/Teams, but solid and secure.\n* Raindrop.io – Bookmark manager that actually makes me *want* to organize stuff. Way better than browser bookmarks.\n* Dropover – Great for dragging/dropping files between apps.\n\nLet me know your favorite not so popular tools. I would love to give it a try.",

      "selftext": "Pocket officially goes offline on July 8, 2025, and if you're like me, you've probably saved half the internet in there. I've been trying out other tools to fill the gap esp ones that offer more than just bookmarking. Here’s what I found:\n\n**1. getrecall.ai :** The best Pocket alternative I’ve used so far. You can save articles, PDFs, and YouTube videos, and it doesn’t just store them. Recall summarizes everything into clean note cards, lets you chat with your content, and automatically builds a self-organizing knowledge base. Still free as of now and works across devices.\n\n**2. Matter:** Polished interface, great for reading saved articles. It offers highlighting and some AI features, but most of the good stuff is behind a paywall. Ideal for a clean reading experience.\n\n**3. Raindrop.io:** More of a visual bookmarking tool. Great for organizing links, tagging, and archiving, but it doesn’t summarize or help you review content in any meaningful way.\n\n**4. Instapaper:** Still around, still solid. Good for saving and highlighting, but not actively evolving and lacks any real AI features.\n\nIf you were using Pocket just to save stuff, most of these will do the job. But if you actually want to understand and retain what you save, Recall is probably your best bet right now.\n\nCurious what others are switching to, open to more recs!\n\nEdited: Removed Omnivore, was an oversight.

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nA couple of months ago I posted about Griply here. The feedback and discussions in this subreddit influenced what we worked on next, so I wanted to check back in at the start of the year. I’m also doing another giveaway below for anyone who missed out last time.\n\nFor anyone new: I’m Amber, and together with a self-funded team I’m building [Griply](https://griply.app). It’s a goal-oriented task manager that combines goal planning, habit tracking, and daily task management in one connected system.\n\n**The problem Griply tries to solve**\n\nMost task managers are very good at execution, but bad at context.\n\nYou end up with flat task lists where long-term goals live somewhere else, habits are tracked separately, and daily planning becomes reactive. As task lists grow, it gets harder to tell which tasks actually move a goal forward and which ones are just maintenance.\n\nGriply is built to make that connection explicit.\n\n**How planning for 2026 works in Griply**\n\nPlanning in Griply starts top-down:\n\n* You define Life Areas (e.g. Work, Health, Personal Projects).\n* Within those, you create Goals with clear success metrics.\n* Goals can be broken down into Subgoals, Habits, and One-off Tasks.\n* Every task and habit is linked to a goal or life area. There’s also an inbox for unassigned tasks.\n\nFor planning:\n\n* Tasks and habits appear in daily and weekly planning views (calendar)\n* You can group or filter by goal, life area, priority, deadline, or date\n* Planning your week always happens based on what matters\n\nThis makes it easier to see what you’re actually working on and where your time is going.\n\n**👩🏼‍💻I’ve written a more detailed guide on how I plan goals for 2026** [**here**](https://griply.app/guides/plan-your-goals-for-2026) **and a video** [**here**](https://youtu.be/l_fI4xmgYmg?si=RO7MpsGO9cqJ_iVT)**.**\n\n**What’s new since my last post**\n\nSince my last post, we’ve focused on improving speed and task management:\n\n* A lot of new task filters and grouping (goal, life area, priority, deadline, date)\n* Life area summary view showing goals, habits, and tasks together\n* Improved goal and subgoal views with clearer structure and progress\n* Faster task editing and multi-select for reorganising plans\n* Learn more on [our changelog](https://griply.app/changelog)\n\n**🎁 Giveaway**\n\nI’m giving away **20 × Lifetime Griply Premium** again.\n\nIf you want to join, just reply and share:\n\n* A goal you’re planning for 2026, or\n* Something you want to structure more clearly this year\n\nI’ll randomly pick 20 people later\n\n(Please make sure you’ve created a Griply account so I can assign the lifetime access)\n\nIf you don’t win and still want to try it, I’m happy to set you up with a free month. There’s also a free version.\n\nGriply is available on iOS, Mac, Windows, and web: [https://griply.app/](https://griply.app/)\n\nThanks again for the thoughtful feedback here.\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper into specific features.\n\n**EDIT: Thank you all so much for your replies, that means a lot! Since there's still a lot of replies coming in, I will pick the winners early next week. I need some time going through all of them 🩷**",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nA couple of months ago I shared [Griply](https://griply.app) in this subreddit, and the feedback I received from this community had a real impact on what we built next. So first of all: thank you!\n\nFor anyone who hasn’t come across Griply yet: it’s a purpose-driven planning system. Most productivity tools are great at managing tasks, but they don’t help you understand *why* a task matters or how it contributes to the bigger picture. That’s the gap we’re solving.\n\nGriply is built around a simple idea:\n\n**When your goals shape your habits and tasks and everything connects back to what you actually care about staying consistent becomes much easier.**\n\nThat’s why Griply starts with clarity. Your vision and life areas define direction. Your goals become structured plans with visual progress, subgoals, habits and tasks. Your daily and weekly planning then flows naturally from that. It’s a full system, not a list of features.\n\nAs we’re nearly at the end of the year, it’s the perfect time to set priorities and start mapping out 2026.\n\nHere’s what’s new since [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductivityApps/comments/1lkzuil/we_just_added_time_blocking_a_goal_roadmap/):\n\n* **Griply for iOS 26:** A fresh new look with liquid glass.\n* **Quick entry:** Press CTRL+space from anywhere to quick add a task to Griply.\n* **Natural language input:** Griply will automatically detect dates, times, priorities, goals, tags, and more.\n* **Increment goal progress:** No more overwriting totals, just add increments to your progress.\n* **Subgoals in subgoals:** Break down even the most complex projects.\n* **Goal descriptions:** Add context/the why/motivation to each goal.\n* **Outlook integration:** See your calendar events alongside your tasks.\n* **Habit scheduling:** Plan habits weeks ahead on the calendar or set different times each day (there’s no other productivity app that allows you to do this flexible habit scheduling).\n* **A lot of keyboard shortcuts:** Faster navigation for power users.\n* And we’re working on soooo much more… we’d love to hear what you’d like us to build next, you can view everything on [our changelog](https://griply.app/changelog).\n\n**For anyone new here: what Griply includes today**\n\nAlongside the new updates, Griply also gives you:\n\n* A goal timeline / Gantt-style roadmap to map your year (perfect for 2026 planning)\n* A daily and weekly planner that pulls in your tasks, habits, and calendar events\n* A full calendar view where your goals and schedule connect\n* Goal dashboards that make your progress visible, not abstract\n* A system where everything (vision, life areas, goals, habits, tasks) works together\n\nThis way you’re not just tracking what you need to do, but actually building momentum toward the outcomes you care about.\n\nMany people are moving over from Todoist, TickTick, and Things because Griply doesn’t just track tasks, it connects every action to the bigger picture.\n\n**🎁 Giveaway**\n\nI’m also planning my own goals for 2026, one of them is to bike from Utrecht to Berlin. It felt fitting to turn this giveaway into a little accountability thread for all of us.\n\nI’m giving away **25 × Lifetime Griply Premium**.\n\nIf you want to join, feel free to share your **biggest goal or project for 2026 in the thread**.\n\nI’ll randomly pick 25 people at the end of the day (14/15 nov depending on the timezone).\n\n(And if you want to try Griply earlier, just DM me and I’ll set you up with a free month). We also have a free version.\n\nGet started here: [https://griply.app/](https://griply.app/)\n\nThanks again for the support and feedback!!\n\nHappy to answer any questions :)",

You can:\n\n* Break down big goals into subgoals, habits, and actionable tasks\n* Set measurable targets (e.g. read 12 books, lose 5kg, save $5k)\n* Organize everything around your life areas (like health, career, relationships)\n* Track progress visually with charts on a dashboard\n* Use widgets on iOS to keep goals, habits, and tasks top of mind\n* Available on Mac, Windows, Web &amp; iOS – all synced (join the waitlist for Android on our website)\n\nIt’s built for people who want to stop just checking off tasks and actually start making consistent progress on *what matters*.\n\n**What’s new in Griply 3.0**\n\nThis is our biggest update yet – and it finally closes the gap between long-term goals and daily actions.\n\n* **Goal Timeline** – Plan goals months and years ahead on a roadmap\n* **Calendar &amp; Time Blocking** – Schedule tasks, goals and life areas with drag &amp; drop\n* **Goal Time Slots** – This is really unique, plan slots on the calendar for your goals or life areas instead of single tasks\n* **New Daily Planner** – Focus each day around your goals, habits, and tasks\n* **Google Calendar Integration** – Show your Google Calendar events\n* **Completely Redesigned Desktop App** – Easier planning on big screens\n\nI’ve attached a short video here showing everything that’s new. And we've shared [all the details on our launch page](http://griply.app/v3).\n\nAlso, Francesco from Toolfinder featured us in a video yesterday where he highlights everything that’s new (which was a nice surprise!): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGgFQ0waUR4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGgFQ0waUR4)\n\n**🎁 Lifetime Giveaway**\n\nTo celebrate the 3.0 launch, I’m giving away Lifetime Premium to the **first 25 people who upvote and reply** to this post (DM me your Griply sign-up email so I can grant you the lifetime access).\n\n* Next 25: 1 year Premium\n* Next 50: 6 months Premium\n\nWe’ll also randomly give away 10 extra Lifetime subscriptions to anyone who replies to this post, including those in the first 100.\n\nPlease DM me with your Griply sign up email address. You can sign up here: [http://griply.app](http://griply.app).\n\n(If you’d like to support us, there’s also a limited Lifetime Deal available on our website for $89.99 → [https://griply.app/pricing](https://griply.app/pricing))\n\nWe’re a passionate bootstrapped team of four building this based on user feedback and closely with our community. If you have thoughts, feedback, suggestions, I’d love to hear from you.\n\nThanks so much for reading!",

      "title": "Official launch: Doco — bring AI into Word. Thanks r/ProductivityApps ❤️ (20 Pro seats)",
      "selftext": "  \n**tl;dr:** We launched **Doco** today — an AI that actually lives *inside* Microsoft Word. It understands your doc, can pull context from your library, and writes back without wrecking formatting. **First 20 folks who sign up and comment get a Pro seat.** We’re also trending on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/products/doco-2) if you feel like supporting!  \n\n\nHey folks — quick follow‑up.\n\nI posted here about a month ago with a rough version of what became **Doco**. The idea came from years of shuttling text between Word and AI tools and wondering why the “real work” was still happening in one app while the “AI magic” lived in another tab.\n\nThis sub gave us honest feedback (thank you). A few themes stuck:\n\n* “Keep it in Word and stay out of the way.”\n* “Don’t mess up styles.”\n* “Let me point the AI at the right files, fast.”\n\nWe took that to heart and pushed for a proper launch. **Doco is live today.** It sits in Word, lets you use @ to reference a file or folder to bring the right context in, and drops results back with the document’s formatting intact. That’s the whole promise.\n\nTo say thanks for the nudge last month, we’re giving **Pro seats to the first 20 people** here.\n\n**How to claim**\n\n1. Sign up: [**trydoco.com**](http://trydoco.com)\n2. Comment **“Signed up”** \\+ your role + what you’d use it for\n3. We’ll DM the upgrade\n\nWe’re also **live on Product Hunt today**. If the story resonates, we’d really appreciate you checking it out and sharing any thoughts: [**https://www.producthunt.com/products/doco-2**](https://www.producthunt.com/products/doco-2)\n\nWe’re still early. Tell us what’s clunky, what saves time, and what button you wish existed. We’ll keep shipping. 🙏",
